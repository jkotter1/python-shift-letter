I will talk to Melissa Brutto on adding this to existing PM.","We worked installing high guard rail around the Union Office at H32.  The work went slow because no stock was removed.  This job should continue tomorrow.
The Pipefitters completed assisting the Hovair Representative reconfiguring the controls for Closure I turntables at station 70 and 120.
Electricians ran power for the crossover Digilube at the beginning of Closure I per K. Malone. 
The AIS Box on RH 120 closure #1 is back on line, we think.   Bad patch cord at the IDF cabinet.    We left it in by-pass at the panel view because it was restarted in the middle of a cycle and was alarming.     Once the line begins move take it out by-pass and see what happens.
7 Robots got remastered over the weekend for pulse coder cable replacements.    7L-30-LR06, 7L-30-RR06, 7K-15-LR01, 7K-15-RR01, 8X-30-1, 8X-30-2, 8X-30-4.   We ran metal thru the body sides affected robots and one long thru Station 30 U/B main to verify sealer path.   If you have issues call Bob Lieblang at (248)-379-9513.   He will answer anytime day or night.
We installed some robot and PLC programming for sealer patch error proofing on 7L-30-RR06.     Error proofing is currently jumped out and the robot programming change is in a new replacement “pick” subroutine.   If there is an issue comment out the “pick” routine ending in WDS and uncomment out the original subroutine.   Each model has its own pick subroutine.   See attached photograph.   The PLC edits are testing.
The Bleichert conveyor health assessment determined  that the sprockets at the load in of the LH Bodysides conveyor was out of time causing the pallets to hang.
Made progress on the REAR door line split.   Moved the recently installed fence line West to make room for 20” pinch point.   Made DCS chances to robots 5C-50-1 and 5C-50-5 to create the 20” pinch point clearance required between the robot and fence for teaching purposes.   Also extended the fence line to the hand off table and made DCS changes to accommodate the fixture and fence for robot 5C-40-4.
We did not move light screens to the front door line because the plan is still undecided and light screens may not be required.
Updated panelview programs for wheel well error proofing in station 30L Body Sides.
The Carpenters completed putting down wood floor in the relocated DMR area.  They also completed to painting work orders.","I will put Mitch’s upcoming TM PM’s in the TM shop PM hangers that are located on the back of the blue locker on the West side of the picnic table against the North Wall.

We touched up the robot program to align better with the locating holes. It was determined the operator was misloading the door ditch rail causing the doors to be off or fall out of the fixture. Issue went away with practice. Root cause is that the operator could position the parts wrong and still get part presents to run.

On the Sta 50 turn table.  On the robotic nut runner installation, we had a few instances of the nut was not picked up from the nut feeder.   When the robot goes to pick the nut from the feeder and misses the nut for whatever reason,  knocks the nut off for instance, then goes to the verification point to verify nut in the socket.  If there is no nut in the socket, the robot stops and sits.  We fault, but the recovery is manual intervention by the electrician.   And if I understand correctly, if there is no nut in the socket and a nut at the feeder, the robot will go back and retry to pick up the nut at the feeder.  But if there is no nut in the socket and no nut at the feeder, the feeder will not cycle another nut.  I’m told the feeder won’t cycle because the robot is not clear of the feeder.  As I look at it, the robot is close but still clear of the feeder to cycle.  Is there a better plan in place for this? 
 
I’m also told we have an ongoing problem with the right side door hemmer.  The doors have tendency to  hang in the spider for a moment as the spider raises up from the anvil.  The door then falls out and lands back into the anvil.  Most of the time the door releases very quickly and does not fall very far.  There is a .5 second delay timer in the processor for this.   Apparently it does not show a fault when this happens but drops auto.  This happened numerous times last night.  Electrician simply puts it back in auto.  I’m told the left side does not do this.

Paint VRT today. Issues with boil out on doors, b pillar hinge bolts. Hem adhesive on doors. Separate note sent to Tim and Mitch.",,6W-40-5 couldn’t deck a body side early this morning because of damage to the cowl side.  Had to zip tie it up and run it out as damaged.  Found a couple more damaged in C03 and repaired them before getting to framer.  8X-85L-3 appeared to be the culprit.  Same pin that was shimmed last night looked like it was even further off location so an additional 1mm shim was added.  After that clamp 101-C2L on the end effector was having issues closing completely because the part isn’t sitting all the way in the nest blocks due to shimming so it was jumped out of the logic.  When production went to lunch the MW’s checked to make sure the robot was secure to the pedestal and to the ground.  End effector was given the shake test but nothing appeared loose.  We stepped through the pickup program and found that it was pulling the assembly off a bit sideways which could lead to some damage.  Touched up the SWB pickup as it was the only model we were having issues with.  Removed the recently installed additional 1mm of shim.  Un-tested edit from logic but the clamp faulted on the 6th unit.  Re-tested edit.  Ran without faults or damaging parts for the remainder of the shift.

Take a seat is at Y31.","7G10L-3 was retrofitted back to factory spec with an upgraded nose seal and air fitting. When I arrived this morning I was told they had not replaced the punch to factory spec and  observed the unit shotgunning so we replaced the stud feed head with one that had been rebuilt under the direct supervision of Henrob's expert and the punch to a factory standard. We ran 4 units before it started shearing the threads. We then replaced the punch and began experiencing jamming conditions. We replaced the stud feed head again and the problem cleared up. Keep and eye on this, we only ran 6 units for verification before they hit their number and stopped.

8A100-01W broken kicker pin.",,"We had the Cowl/Dash down, Station 9B-245-250-1W REO gun was intermittently giving us a nut still in place fault.  This was stopping the cycle.  We replaced the head but this did not solve it.  After getting everyone involved it was determined the air pressure at the MTS feeder was too high and had to lower to 37 from 47psi.  The label for the regulator spec's it at 65lb.     Will need to fix the labeling on this feeder and probably many others.   Removed improper label on this feeder.   JT
RHBS conveyor would not deliver body sides to the main line.    It appeared as if an empty carrier would not release from the unload stop.   The logic was manipulated to release the carrier which turned out to be a mistake.    The unload stop was waiting for a carrier to to be seen in the pre-unload stop before releasing to keep the the two stops in sequence.    The real problem was at the inspection stop where jobs were being held up as well.     Once units reached the pre-unload stop the stops had to be manually operated to get back in sequence.    It is unknown why the jobs were held behind the inspection stop since the stop was opened manually to get carriers moving.   JT

7G-10L-3 Magnetic punch has been removed per Henrob. 
7G-70L-1 After the crash, Programs for Gun # 1 have been touched up.  Toolmakers aligned the main linear bushings and adjusted the gun jaws. Still having issues changed over to gun # 2. 
6Y-180-1 Replace bit in Gun # 1 and adjusted Program 10 Step 15 Max Time from 3.00 sec to 3.25 sec. 
 
Nights - Mitch Snyder
7G-70-L01 – Running gun #2 when I got here. Gun was crashed on days. Parts were replaced and attempted to run. Getting max time step 2 faults so not seeing bit advance. Had TM go over and check all alignment on tool. Try to fire up and validate first thing in the AM. Monitor.
 
6Y-80-09 – Running on gun #2 when I got here. Night-shift electricians said they didn’t do a swap and didn’t know why it was swapped. Fault log showed Step 15 max time exceeded. Seeing strip outs in some spots. TMs PM’d and inspected gun between shifts. Curreny on robot waiting to be validated at start up. Monitor.
 
7K-30-L04 – Running on gun #2 when I got here. Appears to have been swapped for Step 15 max depth exceeded faults 10 days ago on nights. No communication was made to me as to when and why it was swapped. Had EL swap. Tool faulted immediately. Found bit was completely broken. TM installed new bit and tool ran fine.
 
7K-40-R02 – Running on gun #2 when I got here. Swapped about a week ago without any communication. Fault history indicated there was difficulty recovering from a fault and the tool seemed to have double fed. Swapped to gun #1 at 12:30am and tool ran rest of shift without faults.
 
6Y-180-01 – step 15 max time exceeded faults. Program 9. Seeing strip outs still on program 9. Lowered pressure on step 14 from 1.5V to 1.2V at 11:45pm. No more faults on that program for the rest of shift. Monitor.
 
6Y-180-02 – Step 14 max time exceeded. Program 8. Appears we are missing blind clearance hole on hinge pillar. Need to touch up but need a good template to do so. Will work with inspectors on getting one cut out of our teardown unit.
 
5G-210-01 – Nordson panel HMI failure. See maintenance note for details.
 
7L-30-R04 – Gun #1 – All spots for joint 2181 were measuring low at -0.32mm and deeper. Worked with inspector and EL to adjust velocity on those spots from 150mm/s to 120mm/s. Verified rivets measured good (approx. -0.10mm) and taught Rivmon. Cut off 6850.
 
7G-10-L03 – Talked to operator when I got in about suspect studs. He said he had been checking every part since he got in and had not seen any studs with chewed up threads. Checked back in at end of shift and he said we were still clean. Monitor.
 
8Y-10-05 – FIS shows faults spiking up on this tool. I did not get to work on it but something to keep an eye on.
 
7X-10-L01 – Heat cool error. Hoover had mentioned doing something with the heating zone at the gun before I got here but I do not recall what. Keep an eye on it.
 ",Item #1 on tailgate hang is operator related.  Only the C crew sta 26 causes this fault.,"Nordson controller HMI on sta 210-1 on the hood line evidently failed to restart after this weekend’s buss outage.  No one realized it until pipefitters replaced sealer barrel tonight and we could not switch barrels.  Terry located a replacement HMI from the vault and installed it.  We looked for the configuration file for that sealer system per the instruction sheet in the U55X controls folder, but were not able to find one for that systen.  Found one for another for another Nordson sealer system and used it.  It is working, sealer system is up and but not sure everything is fully correct.  We used the only HMI on hand.  Need to order more.

7K-50-L06 - 3 hours breakdown. Was getting wrapped up when I got here. Root cause seems to be internal failure of setter not allowing punch to fully return home. This setter is the one that riveted on a FDS yesterday and had a handful of double rivets last time we had a robot crash. Took failed 250072 setter (235k cycles/57.3kn average force) to rebuild shop with Henrob and took front end apart. Did not find damage to the shear pin but Henrob confirmed there was an abnormal gap between the shaft coupler and back end of the setter.

Nights-Snyder (Spent almost the entire night at 6Y-80-09)
7K-50-L06 - Feed fault - 5x for 11min - Tool is notorious for feed faults and more often than not we go in the cell to find the nose is turned crooked. Being that it is a ped riveter the only way this nose could be getting turned is if it is being clipped by the part during, before, or after riveting. We were going to change the GBSD AGAIN tonight but once the crooked nose was found we did not. Straightened nose and tool ran fine. KUKA is going to be looking into the robot programs to see if there is anything hitting the nose. From outside the cell I could not see anything on LWB or SWB. Could be a sporadic thing...monitor.
 
6Y-80-09 - Step 2 max time exceeded - Program 11 LWB - 23x for 1hr12min - Began shift on gun #1 and faulting just it had been most the day. TMs cleaned head and replaced bushing before I got here. Step #2 is designed to monitor the bit advancing forward in its early stages of movement. Basically it is just looking for any movement at all. Whenever a LWB would come in and program 11 would be called the tool would go to the spot and touch down to the part and do a retry and then would fault for step 2. We could clearly see the bit advance and see it contact the screw. The Weber would then call for a clear screw at nose. We would initiate the CSAN and it would go in and go to the same spot and screw just fine. We checked cables…found nothing. Checked parameters and saw nothing abnormal compared the SWB program for the spot (exact same). We began troubleshooting with the following observations and parameter adjustments and modifications..
Cross referenced program 4 (same spot on SWB). No real difference between the 2.
Increased time in step 2 from 3 seconds to 4 seconds. No better.
Increased voltage to proportional valve in step 1 from 1.5V to 2V. No better.
Adjusted routing of signal cables and installed cable tie to hold them in a better position. No better.
Monitored I/O signals to and from the tool. Witnessed the signal being sent to move the spindle but the tool was not moving.
Decreased depth gradient target in step 2 so much so that is was essentially not being monitored. No better.
Turned off depth gradient monitoring in step 7. This seemed to clear up the issue but then we also noticed analog depth was and most likely has been turned off on this step which is dangerous for the tool.
Turned analog depth monitoring on for Step 7 and set it to a min of -25mm and a max of -18mm. We immediately started seeing depth faults because the spindle was now jumping straight to this step and moving so fast. Could not find a good way to get around this. We were faulting and not able to get out of the fault due to this.
Went into the cell with teach pendant and manually screwed the cab to monitor analog depth sensor functionality and see if there was anything that would be causing the spindle not to advance. Spindle advanced just fine and analog depth sensor worked as it should.
Finally at end of shift to get back to a good starting point for troubleshooting we changed all program 11 steps to match program 4 again. After doing this we were able to run 6 LWB units with zero issues. Something we had not been able to do the entire shift.
 
I am not confident the issue is fixed as I have nothing for a root cause and we really did not do anything to fix it. It just “magically” got better. I am being told by the EL that the issue follows over to gun #2 as well. My last guess is for whatever reason the robot position at program 11 on LWB interferes with the signal cable so the gun does not get the signal to advance the spindle. But it does not make sense because program 4 has a nearly identical spot and no issues. Also the retry works just fine.
 
6Y-80-10 – Internal torque faults – Gun #1 – Transducer was swapped between shifts. Tool ran fairly well most the shift but would get random internal torque faults. EL swapped to gun #2 because we could get the faults to go away towards end of shift. EL lined up to swap XS41B cable between shifts. This is the lite signal cable from the transducer to the gun. Will need to be validated and monitored on day-shift. ","Faults 3, 4, and 5 on top 10 main are all operator issues.  They break the light screen before the rotation of the Model Pins is finished.  The usual operator was off tonight.
 
 ","50-4 Rear door line- Was getting bad picks from fixture and robot would not release door on drop off. At first it looked to be that the pin clamps where off location. Possible crash ?? We shimmed the clamps on the pick up and run 4 doors without issue. On the 5th door the robot pulled the pin stops through the door not picking from the turn table. Pin clamp was damaged and changed put in FRACAS cage. Root cause was a error proofing guide on the turn table that the door was dragging on and the weight of the robot on the pick causing it to dig into error proofing bracket. TM grinded the bracket down with no other issues.-BC           
 
Closures station 190 had a lot of torque faults on 190L2 pencil brace. Electricians looked at it and wanted the sockets changed. Sockets changed, follow up required.","FOLLOW UP ON 50-4 REAR DOOR LINE: The grinding done was the correct fix for this just wasn't enough. The issue with dragging the part off the end effector continued. The operator said the robot has been making a screaching noise when removing the parts for months. Inspection of the blocks showed hard wear from dragging the parts out of the fixture. In addition there were grooves worn into the blocks. When the trim edge slipped into the grooves it pulled the pin clamps through the metal. The blocks were ground off until the parts had clearance and the problem was resolved.  See Attachments.
The adjustments made on one face made the clamp stick on the other. In trying to fix that the robot was left close to the turntable not realizing the zone had been cleared. The table turned hitting the robot bending a net block that had to be replaced.
 
We have now had a third AirEye Fan bite the dust over here on closures.   These things have been in service less than six months and they are starting to drop like flies.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Follow-Ups From Days
6Y-80-09 – New signal cable is working well. No faults. No issues.
 
6X-60-04 – Did not see any Step 14 max torque exceeded faults during the time I was here. Ran very well. Will continue to monitor.
 
6Y-80-10 – Front end swap seemed to have worked. Tool ran great.
 
7X-30-R04 – Gun #1 – No more feed faults since GBSD swap.
 
Tonight’s Notes
No calls or reports from production on any issues in the sub assembly tools.
 
7L-30-R04 – Gun #1 – Nose switch fault – 24x for 8min – EL was able to limp tool for a while but got to point where faults wouldn’t go away. Swapped GBSD and nose at 87k cycles. No more issues after swap. Need to educate ELs not to “fault reset” nose switch faults. It will cause the tool to dry fire potentially damaging the tool and for sure damaging the part which will require rivet repair. Nose switch faults can’t just be “reset.”
 
7X-20-R03 – Encoder error – 5x for 28min – Hoover swapped ATI module which fixed the issue.
 
7L-30-R04 – Encoder error/drive faults – 22x for 20min – Hoover swapped ATI module which fixed the issue.
 
7X-10-R02 - Wheel well hem adhesive – Hand off from afternoons state bead was too large and causing excessive squeeze out. Tried to adjust bead volume through robot. This yielded no visible results. Due to RHBS running one for one with framer we did not stop the line to investigate further. Will follow up on days with PFs and attempt to adjust volume through Nordson interface. Bead could be moved but volume needs to be addressed first.
 
6Y-180-02 – Gun #1 – Step 1 internal torque faults – 1x for 15min – Tool faulted out on first spot. EL had issues with FFR because tool was looking for CSAN but would fault as soon as it went back in. Internal faults indicated a major issue so we shipped job as suspect and swapped guns. Thinking we could possibly have a bad transducer we ran a friction test before swapping which passed with flying colors. During the swap we noticed the tennis bracket support was completely loose allowing the dress cables and hoses spin and smack around as the tool ran. Had EL tighten mount right away. Ran the remainder of shift on gun #2. For the last 20 units we swapped back to gun #1 which ran perfecy fine without issue. I believe something got very out of sequence. Will keep an eye out for similar situation in future.
 
",,,"7L30R04 gun2 had encoder faults and drive faults. We tried the encoder cable from the ATI to the gun first and that did not help. Then we went in when it was faulted and saw that the umbilical was wrapped around the lolipop. We changed the umbilical and that did not help either. Finally we changed the EC6T module on the gun side and this corrected the issue. I had changed that same module on the gun about 6 weeks ago. See 4D
 
7X20-3 gun2 was having encoder faults and ""unknown position"" faults.  Joe noticed that the faults appear to happening when the robot is just getting ready to drop off gun1 so we replaced the EC6T module on gun1. MONITOR

7X10R-2 Hem adhesive appeared too wide. The volume was reduced but it started to fault, the program was raised by 2mm, the volume was returned to the previous setting and the programs accuracy was opened up to help with the choppiness of the bead. Looks good now.

Nights – Snyder
8Y-10-06 – Step 15min depth not reached – 19x for 29min – Parameter changes didn’t seem to help much. EL are quick to respond so I didn’t personally see any of faults. Looking at the fault history it looks like faults are occurring on programs 9 and 19 primarily with some program 5s mixed in . I talked to the EL and he said he made the following parameter adjustments already at EOS to try and improve the faults.
Program 9 Step 13 analog signal increased to 1.1V
Program 19 Step 13 analog signal increased to 1.1V
Program 5 Step 13 analog signal increased to 1.1V
Monitor.
 
7K-30-L04 – Was on gun #2 at start up. Looked at fault history and saw faults for about a week ago but they just indicated the tool going in without a screw. Swapped back to gun #1 at 11pm and had zero issues remainder of shift.
 
7K-40-R02 – Is curreny running gun #2. We had extensive downtime on 7X-10-R02 so I did not want to risk stopping the line any more. Will swap tomorrow night to see whats going on if it is still on gun #2 when I come in.
 
9A-40-01 – BT3 faults – 6x for 45min – TMs were called. They took apart the escapement. Cleaned and stoned the block as well as cleaned the track. Not aware of any more issues after this.
 
7X-10-R02 – Seal Controller Major Fault – 10x for 1hr20min – Path would start out fine but then would have large skips and thin beads. Thought to be debris in nozzle. Cleared nozzle. Still had issue. Replaced nozzle (took quite some time to locate one). While waiting for nozzle purged the entire system to get rid of any potential globs of adhesive. New nozzle did not fix issue. Still not getting pressure out of the nozzle. Replaced dispense valve at end of gun. No more issues. Monitor.

 ","Had more issues with 7G right side roof rail hydro form.  Production is reaming the burr from the hole in question.  But also had issues on robot 60R1 dropping the part to the fixture.  Appears as if someone attempted to touch up the program.  Robot was pulling the part off the tooling after dropping the part and moving away.  Pin clamp cylinder pin was rubbing on the locating pin hole and taking the part with it.   Scott Stidham touched it up so it would come out cleanly.

Lift Table 19 in the mezz at CC-37 had the channel with the guide block for up/down and for/aft break off. The table shifted coming down on the frame. This caused the table to angled and twisted.

8Y-30-04 – Nose switch fault- 1x for 5min – EL tried feed fresh tape and blowing nose out with air. Switch was staying on no matter what we did. Called TM to do swap.

8Y-10-06 – Numerous various FDS process faults – 8x for 12min – Gun was swapped on afternoon shifts. Not many faults since gun was swapped. TMs are PM’ing gun #1 in between shifts. Will need to be validated.
 
8Y-10-05 – Step 7 max depth exceeded, Step 14 max torque exceeded, Step 15 min depth not reached – 5x for 10min – Faults on programs 5, 9, 7 and 17. Faults and programs are inconsistent to say the least. TMs are PM’ing gun #1 between shifts. Will need to be validated.
 
8Y-20-04 – Rivmon head too high – 3x for 5min – Faults on programs 2, 4, 5 and 9. Nominal was riding consisteny on higher end. Inspectors verified rivets as good so we adjusted nominal end distance.
 
7X-30-R01 – Nose switch fault – 2x for 1min – EL tried resetting fault. Resulting in dry fires, excessive force faults and bodyside that needed to be repaired. Told him not to do this next time. Swapped GBSD at 123k cycles.
 
Top 10 #8 6X-40-01 – Rivmon head too high – 5x for 15min – Faults on programs 121 and 181. Velocity was adjusted on program 121 per inspectors measurements. Nominal end distance was also adjusted to resolve faults.
 
6X-60-01 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 4x for 11min – Faulting on program 11. Depth tolerance set at -1.5mm in step 15. Faults were right at -1.5mm. Bumped depth target to -1.6mm. EL also reported gun was sticking. Tool is set to PM’d this weekend.
 
6X-40-01 – Rivmon speed too fast – 2x for 5min – Velocity adjusted on program 121. Rivmon was eventually taught once rivets were verified by inspector.
 
Top 10 #3 – 6Y-80-10 – Various FDS process faults – 4x for 25min – Faults all over the place as far and step and programs. EL did report gun was dirty and sticking which caused quite a few of the faults and recovery issues. TMs are PM’ing gun #1 between shifts. Will need to be validated.
 
Top 10 #5 – 6Y-80-09 – Step 7 min depth not reached – 3x for 16min – EL reported this gun was sticking as well. TMs are PM’ing gun #1 between shifts. Will need to be validated.
 
6Y-180-01 – Step 7 min depth not reached – 6x for 11min – Faulting on programs 10 and 12. The depth reading at -26mm indicates the tool is missing the clearance hole. Robot program needs to be touched up. No EL available to do so between shifts tonight. Needs to be followed up on.
 
6Y-180-02 – Step 15 max time exceeded – 1x for 5min – On afternoon shift they damaged a bit and jaws so they swapped to gun #2. Gun #2 ran well. TMs are lined up the repair gun #1 between shifts. We have swapped a bit on this tool every day this week I believe. Will be monitoring next production run to see what is causing this. Possibly too much pressure at the needle valve on the gun or program adjustments that were made prior to touch ups last week are now hurting us. Will follow up.",,,,,,"TL

Nights – Snyder
8Y-10-06 – On gun #2 when I got here. Was told gun #1 was PM’d and good to go. Swapped to gun #1 around lunch and immediately got internal torque faults in step 1. Started preparing to swap transducer but ended up finding transducer was completely unplugged. Not sure if this was done in PM or what. Something to keep an eye on. Gun ran rest of shift without issues.
 
6X-60-04 – Step 7 min depth not reached (double feed) – 5x for 16min – Saw some random depth gradient exceeded faults on step 5, 6 and 7. All on program 2. To resolve depth gradient faults we increased depth gradient parameter from 100mm/s to 110mm/s in steps 5,6 and 7 on program 2. I think the tool is still trying to auto recover and then double feeding screws which then creates a breakdown that requires manual intervention to clear jam. Was not able to see it happen. EL also noted that gun #1 seemed to be sticking periodically. Toolmakers PM’d gun #1 between shifts. Found it dirty and needing alignment.
 
6X-60-02 – Step 14 max time exceeded – 1x for 15min – EL was tied up on another breakdown. No re-occurrences. Monitor.
 
6X-190-06 – Feed fault – 2x for 15min – EL started getting feed faults that he could not get out of. GBSD was at 342k cycles. Punch and die were at 674k cycles. TM went to swap GBSD and found punch was extremely loose. Since he was already there tightening it he just swapped it along with the die. No more issues.
 
6Y-80-10 – 4x for 48min – Nearly 40min of downtime was due to fault being latching from 5:30pm-6:35pm. EL reported gun was sticking when he tried to do an eject during FFR. TM PM’d gun #1 between shifts. We found it to be caked with adhesive causing the screw release flap to stick. TM swapped entire head assembly so they could PM/rebuild offline.
 
6Y-80-09 – Gun #1 was sticking when trying to eject. TM PM’d gun #1 between shifts. We found it to be caked with adhesive causing the screw release flap to stick. TM swapped entire head assembly so they could PM/rebuild offline.
 
6Y-180-02 – Had a doozy of a breakdown before I got here appareny and it was reported the bit was broken. It was on gun #2 when I got here. Had TMs go check out gun #1 between shifts. Did not find any broken bit nor anything blatany wrong with gun. TMs PM’d/cleaned tool anyways. Curreny on gun #1 awaiting validation. Robot program may need to be looked at??
 
7G-50-L01 – Gun Festo valve pack swap – During PM on afternoon shift TM noted Festo valve not working properly when they tried to advance the hold down device. Tim had purchased a valve pack from stores over in P body. Ended up finding this valve does not work for our tools as they use 3 ports (we use 4 due to active jaw design). I could not find any other type of valve pack in stores. We found one in our Kardex machine but it was the valve pack for the feeder, not the gun. We ended up taking a known good valve from our valve pack and replacing the blank port on the 558 valve. This worked out fine. Clinton Anderson digging into finding out where our valve packs are or if we have any set up at all. Malfunctioning valve is in FRACAS area.
 
7A-30-L01 – Rivet stuck in tube – 1x for 32min – Rivet not making it from exit track to feed stick. Ended up finding the t-tube had worked itself free from exit track. Had PF snug everything back up. Fired a bunch or rivets through the system manually to validate and put back together. Ran rest of shift without issue. Will try to get around to changing t-tube tomorrow.
 
7K-20-R01 – Gun #1 – Wanted to dive into this one tonight but couldn’t due to bodyside overhead conveyor being empty most the shift. Still running on back-up.","Touched up the pickup on 7X15L01.
 
Replaced a bad valve on 5G30POC. The FIS said R1 but it was really the pullout cart.","We were getting some drive faults on 7K30R01 gun1. We cleaned the pins and that seemed to take care of it. There is an EC6T in the line side cabinet if it comes back again.
At T28 there is a roof leak running down the column into a lighting panel. Larimore was notified via email.
Moved Camera screen at W-34 for improved inspection and relocated accept/reject buttons. (Honeycut)",The VOS cell monitor issue is back again. A note was sent to Hesse.,,,"Water Leak at FF26.6 creating a large puddle. It is close to but not getting on the buss. Plastic put over the buss to keep splash water from reaching the buss.

8Y-10-05 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 3x for 5min – Seeing faults on program 9 primarily. Faults are reading at a depth of anywhere from -1.6mm to -1.9mm. Considered opening up that parameter slighy but found that a good process yields a depth of 0mm to -0.1mm. Monitor.

#5 8X-100-06 – Head too low – 3x for 18min – Had 2 units (1 LWB/1 SWB) come through back to back. Both faults every single spot for head too low. Was approx. 0.7-0.8mm out of tolerance. Rivets measured out good so we taught Rivmon to it. Rivmon faults followed the units all the way through respot (8Y-20,100,110) as well. All rivets were in same area. Original assumption was maybe 8X-30-04 did not apply adhesive to the front ladder on these units. Checked camera footage but it was not pointed to that location so I could not confirm or deny this. Pulled units out at end of respot and could see squeeze out in most all areas so adhesive was definitely there. Once teach 100 ran out we began getting “head too high” faults which further indicates there was something off with only those two units. Rivmon data returned back to what it was and we taught again. I watched 8X-30-04 put adhesive on over 20 units perfecy fine and verified no faults in Nordson system. No root cause found…rivets were good and squeeze out was there. 
 
8Y-110-02 – Head too low – 2x for 11min – See above for detailed description.
 
8Y-20-02 – Head too low – 2x for 9min – See above for detailed description.
 
8Y-20-02 – Head too high – 2x for 3min – See above for detailed description.
 
7K-20-R01 – Gun #1 – Tried switching to gun #1. Thought possibly there wasn’t enough air pushing the screw to nose. I increased the blow time and turned the holding air valve on so it stayed on 100% of the time in hopes this would feed and keep the screw in the head of the gun. Faulted on very first job. Didn’t want to kill the shop so we swapped back to gun #2. Have some solid ideas that I am going to try this weekend. Stay tuned for updates.
 
6Y-80-10 – Tool change communication faulted – 2x for 11min – Fault was occurring and dropping cell out of auto. EL found orange Ethernet communication cable from J3 to ATI was bad. Ran cable externally to get us through shift. Cable will be dressed properly between shifts. We have lost a few of these. I am not sure what we can do to improve situation.
 
#1 8E-220-03 – Head too low – 7x 1hr23min – Cannot answer for why it was down so long as it was never called out. However wanted to note this because it was #1 on the sub top X and it corresponds perfecy with the rivmon issues we saw in underbody main/respot. All of these tools rivet on the front ladder. Something was not right with that ladder. Don’t know what but it was odd..
 
#3 7A-20-R01 – End of track PP not made – 2x for 1hr6min – Nut was stuck in chute right at prox which kept prox on. Thus not telling the tool to feed anymore nuts. This starved the feed arm on the press. EL tapped the chuting and the tool took off feeding nuts. Shory after the tool timed out when trying to fill the cutting. Found nuts jammed up in the chuting after they exited the feeder. Shaking the chute freed these nuts up and the tool ran the rest of the shift. If issues keep popping up we may need to run some new chuting.
 
#4 8E-240-05 – Head too low – 6x for 49min – See 8E-220-03 above.
 
8A-110-01 – Got a call tool was over cycling. After watching the tool for one part I noticed it was retrying to feed and having to go back to its home position from a very small partial in order to feed rivets. GBSD was at 427k cycles but showed zero feed faults in the fault history. Then noticed the spool had less than 30 rivets on it. Had EL change spool and issue went away. Was just struggling to pull an empty spool. If issue happens again we can optimize the sprocket pressure to better pull both full and empty spools. ",,,"6X20R01 had a feed stick issue.

7K-20-R01 – Spent most of the night on gun #1 working with EL, PF and TM. We were able to teach the robot to the position we see the faults most and troubleshoot methodically to figure out what was wrong. Ended up finding that the brand new gun (and most likely the gun on there before) were out of adjustment on the cylinder that sets the height of the floating head. This was causing the bit to stop the screw from entering the head of the gun. We could not manually send a screw out to save our lives. Once we set the head where it allowed the screw to drop we were able to successfully feed 20-30 screws to the head without a single issue. Once it is verified to be working in production I will be following up with Weber on why a gun would come to us out of adjustment. Once got through our process of elimination and figured out what needed to be done the adjustment wasn’t difficult to complete. We all learned a ton. Huge thank you to the team involved tonight.

Nights – Snyder
7X-20-R10 – Gun #2 – Feed faults – 14x for 24min (#4 top X) – EL kept resetting fault to keep it running. TM swapping GBSD and nose between shifts. GBSD at 66k cycles.
 
7X-30-R02 – Gun #1 – Excessive tool force – 3x for 16min (#7 top X) – Seeing faults on spots 31 and 61. This tool is a high force tool averaging at 72kn. Peak force was riding on the upper limit on these two spots. ELs turned off max force monitoring and we adjusted the peak force nominal tolerance after inspector confirmed rivets were good.
 
7A-20-R13 – Tool probe A position – 1x for 1hr53min – Breakdown was never called out. Showed up in FIS. Checked tool to find we have been seeing probe faults for a while. Checked to see if we have a spare mag in shop and did not find anything (Part #:MA530353U). There are 11 in stores for 12k a piece if issues persist. Really need to look at getting started on switching these 4 mag tools to tape. Money was moved to us late 2017 according to John Eidt. We have had nearly 30 hours of downtime since the first of the year just on the mag tools in this cell. Most of the downtime is response time related and the tooling can be fixed much quicker/better so it continues to run but with this being such a low visibility area with issues with response time if we can completely eliminate the potential for these faults we should. Not to mention we are going to have to keep inventory just for these tools alone as they do not share common parts with any other tool in the shop.
 
7X-20-R10 – Gun #1 – No faults but GBSD was at 217k cycles and TMs were over there working on gun #2 so I had them do a swap on gun #1 as well.

7G-70-L01 – Head not back (in auto) – Tool was back on gun #2 just after I got here. Went and talked to Scott Stidham about what was going on. We went in and saw the spindle home prox was slighy out of adjustment. We moved it in a lite bit. We also noticed that the air hoses were crimped pretty tight with zip-ties and routed in a way that was pulling them very hard. We removed 2 zip ties and cleaned it up. I told Scott if the faults persists we need to check to ensure the Weber sees itself at home. If it does then there is potentially an issue with the ATI. Monitor.
 
7L-30-R06 – Adhesive touch up – At end of shift EL touched up adhesive on 554 units at the top of the rear DOP. The adhesive was squeezing out into a nut location so we reduced the volume from 6.3cc to 5.5cc. Unit looked much better after touch-up while still maintaining good wet-out.","#4 - Swapped GBSD and nose. Were not overdue but faulting at 66k cycles.

7L30L-02 Clinch tool faulted with what should have been a tool check failure but I cannot be certain. By the time I got there the HMI was being powered down due to a system variable fault that had locked it up. Rick from Tox showed up and had to reload the program that he stated was corrupted during the power down. He will be helping with an SPL. The tooling is curreny running with Tool check blocked and bypassed until we can determine the cause of the failure. Pressure should be reading back at 5 bar but is hitting 11 bar. Transducer is thought to be the problem. Cannot locate one. Cleaned adhesive from punch and die as well. Rick indicated that punch and die were due for change but was not critical and was not causing the tool check fault. We do  not have the correct punch or die on hand nor do they come up in stores. We do have a nice stock of P558 parts in our Tox cabinet that Rick believes will not work. Haven't tried or checked.","MAIN:

7K-20-R01 – Gun #1 – Step 4 max depth exceeded – 11x for 11min – Back to getting sporadic step 4 max depth exceeded faults followed up by double feeds. EL swapped guns to get through the night. At the end of shift we swapped back and jogged the tool onto job. Had TM adjust the floating head further. Fed a bunch of screws out manually and ran 5 parts without issues. Monitor.
 
9C-220-R01 – Profil head unit stud not made – 2x for 1hr15min – Originally had stud not made fault. EL sent 2 more out manually and the press fired down on 2 studs completely blowing up the punch and head of the press. TM came to replace head. Once head was replaced things were all out of sequence. Had KUKA come over and assist Jackey in getting the robot home, part dropped and cycle complete. After this unit ran fine. Ordered replacement head for 14k.
 
7A-30-01 – Rivet stuck in tube – 1x for 53min – Downtime was a result of this being down same time as dash. Originally had rivet stuck in tube fault. EL reset and ended up with multiple rivet fault. TM came and cleared rivets from feedstick and tool ran rest of shift without issue.
 
8A-100-01 – Reports of 8 more pans missing nuts. Went in after shift and fired over 50 nuts manually onto a cross member (doing this to create coupons for repair as well). Did not see anything wrong with the press. REO claims the feed arm is bent but in my opinion if it was bent we wouldn’t put 99% of our nuts on fine and only miss one here and there. The press has no way of error proofing to tell us if the punch kicked the nut off before it is place on the part. We need to find out what is wrong with the press but to protect ourselves from major containment/issues in the future we should look at putting nut-present switches in the drop nest so we can find out if we are missing nuts before they are assembled into a full pan. Also we are in a bad spot as far as repair procedure goes on this nut. Getting with PVT in regards to this today.",,"Had trouble with C55 HL9. See 4D.

8A100-01W Front pan REO press. We had 2 missing Spac nuts first thing this morning then monitored the rest of the day. I was not made aware of any others. We are installing a laser to detect the nut when it's fully on the pan and the die. The logic will stop the line and generate a fault when the nut is not present. See attached pic.  Online and verified to stop. 
 
TOX dies and punches for bodysides arrived today and are on my desk if you need them. Tomorrow they will be properly inventoried in the TM shop. 
7A20R-13 mag over fill faults. TM's emptied and we ran  
7A10-01 nut feeder had a foreign object lodged in the feed tube.  
7X20L-1 feed faults, while removing the GBSD we found the punch damaged and loose most likely from the double rivet fault that happened just before the feed faults started. Changed the GBSD and nose while we had it off to replace the punch. Started back up and got another feed fault immediately so we adjusted the nose.  
6X90-2 broken die. Same tab broken off as the others, watched several run but did not see any contact between the die and the unit. It's possible that the die was damaged last week when we noticed it hitting the front of the cowl top. I was able to secure 12 dies and we have shipped out 5 for repair through stores. Keep all damaged TOX clinch dies as we have all of them set up with a General stores repair part number. Repair price $160, new $772.",Worked on skewed pallets in the pallet farm.    See details in repair.,,,,"Adjusted the brake on TT18.   It was not evenly adjusted.    Seems to be working well.    Left the jack screw in place and the cover off until it proves out for a shift or two.   Was going to change the rectifier for good measure but discovered it is not set up in stores.     Note sent to Dave to set it up.
Adjusted a belt in the pallet farm to synchronize the vulcanized sections of belts between the two strands.    The vulcanized areas are raised and affect the transfer to the next belt.    The theory is that if we put the high spot across from each other they will both have the same impact on the transfer and keep the pallet straight.    Might be a stretch?
Installed a part holder in cowl dash so that the operator had a place to build up the cowl top inner other than resting it on a stack of dunnage.
 Was not able to torque down the motor contactor leads for the high lift feeding closrure 2 to a specified torque.    According to Evan the torque wrench would not adjust low enough.

Nights – Snyder
#1 8X-80-04 – Head too low – 1x for 37min – Unit blew through station 70 without a pan. Gun tried to rivet without pan. Hence the Rivmon fault. Took a while to get unit damaged out and sent on its way.
 
8Y-10-06 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 6x for 10min – Seeing sporadic faults for min. depth step 15. However mainly on programs 5 and 15. Faulting at about -2.1mm so screw is indeed sitting high. May need to look at robot program. Monitor.
 
7L-50-R06 – Nose switch fault – 2x for 25min – GBSD and punch showed 4k cycles from us changing it the other day. Went in and found punch was stuck in nose and had pushed the nose out of the GBSD. TMs called to change punch and nose. Found punch had to decent chips in it and nose looked pretty worn. TMs did not have the punch or the nose on cart so had to wait for them to get it. Once swapped no more issues. I think the nose or the punch weren’t changed the other day. Punch showed a lot of wear along with the nose. Monitor. Also printing an “inventory” list for TMs so they can make sure they have at least one of each nose, punch and die on the cart. A lot of time is wasted fetching parts.
 
7K-30-R01 – Head too low – 2x for 5min – Adjusted end distance nominal on spot 31 and 32. No more issues.
 
#6 6X-80-04 – Head too high – 5x for 15min – Faults on spots 184, 64, 124 and 187. End distance nominal adjusted for all. No more issues.
 
#7 6X-80-03 – Head too low – 7x for 15min – Faults all across the board. Found velocity had been changed on all spots at 2pm. Rivmon was never taught for the changes so we got hit with a bunch of faults during shift. ELs need to ensure a change is verified and adjusted before passing onto next shift. End distance nominal has been taught but complete Rivmon teaching may need to happen to capture it all without further faults.
 
#9 6X-20-03 – Fill when not at dock – 7x for 15min – Fault history shows one real occurrence that was just reset multiple times. Happened before I got here. Hoover reports dock present prox was adjusted. Will monitor.
 
7K-30-R04 – Gun #1 – Still on back-up when I got here. Faults showed step 15 max time exceeded (strip out) on all spots. Went in and found bit had a lite bit of play when trying to engage a screw by hand. TM changing bit between shifts. Gun will be good to be verified at start up.
 
8A-100-01 – Nut not present with ran advanced – 19x for 44min – Appears switch that was added is working. Did not get to watch the press while it was running. Still need to find out why the nut is flying off. Continue to monitor.
 
8Y-100-05 - GBSD/Nose swap. That completes the list on FIS for mainline.","#1 8X-80-04 – Head too low – 1x for 37min – Unit blew through station 70 without a pan. Gun tried to rivet without pan. Hence the Rivmon fault. Took a while to get unit damaged out and sent on its way.

End distance nominal has been taught but complete Rivmon teaching may need to happen to capture it all without further faults.

Noted that cycle complete did not get reset during the occurrence.    Pallet entering is supposed to reset cycle complete.    Pallet entering depends on a compare statement on the encoder value of the incomming pallet.    Kuka opened up this window similar to what Valiant did in Framer 2 to fix the blow thru Marty white caught a couple of months ago.   Mike Weimer also programmed a pallet entering fault based on a valid encoder value being achieved 3.5 seconds after a pallet is sent from the previous station.

8Y-10-06 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 7x for 11min – Faults on programs 5 and 15. Gun was swapped before I got here due to faults. EL touching up between shifts.
 
#1 6X-20-01 – Head too low – 1x for 1hr27min – Before I got here originated with nose switch faults. Which then led to a dry fire (head too low). Feedstick was swapped to fix nose switch faults. After this for some reason tool was taught to dock because it was thought it didn’t have rivets. Once docked we continuously got rivet not trapped faults. Went in and PF said when they swapped feedstick it was extremely difficult to install t-tube. Looked at tool and noticed the wrong feedstick had been installed. We had a 5mm feedstick on a 5mm+ tool so the tube would never fit in there thus giving us rivet not trapped faults. Once correct feedstick was installed we were able to run fine. Large misunderstanding of magazine tools was evident. Spent time explaining things to TM to help them better understand.
 
6Y-180-04 – Numerous FDS issues – Tool was swapped to gun #2 before I got here due to “hold down dev ret not reached” faults. Tool was sticking. When gun was swapped it did not make one of the docked proxes on the ATI. Barely tapped the tool and the prox made. We also had quite a few max time exceeded faults on gun #1 which also could be due to the needed PM. Also had BT3 faults…escapement jammed. TM cleaned escapement. TM also PM’d gun #1 between shifts.

7K-40-R08 - Had a FDS fault on the very last part as line was running out. Inspectors and operators had already left. Had to do a skip once so there is a 553 SWB failsafe at inner pull-out missing a FDS that will need to be repaired before putting back in line. Fault was on program 3 for step 7 max depth exceeded. Was off by 0.2-0.5mm..adjusted depth in step 7.

Historical information at the perceptron showed this camera had faulted 120 times out of 243 units.    Ran several units to verify operation.    We also checked pick-up position and it looked good.    We checked zero of every axis on the robots and gave the end-effector a good shake test.    No issues found.    The perceptron tech agreed with Troy Teno that the load to average is functional but that when the pick-up points were touched up the average data that had been compiled was no longer valid due to the position of the part in the end-effector.   Pereptron is supposed to send us a full report and a single point lesson on how to but the perceptron in camera by-pass mode (Backup Scheme).

Nights – Snyder
#7 8Y-10-06 – 11x for 19min – Step 15 min depth not reached and step 15 max time exceeded – Seeing both strip outs and torque outs on this tool. Mainly programs 19 and 11. EL adjusted pressures in step 8 to try and resolve issues. Did not run long enough after to see if this made a difference. I do not believe this has been touched up in a while. If issues continue we may need to look into checking perpendicularity of the programs.
 
8Y-10-05 – Was on gun #2 when I got here. Only had 2 faults from what I could see. Swapped back to gun #1 at 1:30am and it ran well for the rest of the shift. Monitor.
 
#3 6X-60-01 – 3x for 29min – Step 5 max depth gradient exceeded (program 9) – EL were tied up on another fault. Tool faulted out for depth gradient at 101.5mm/s with tolerance set to 100mm/s. Opened this up on program 9 as well on program 7. No more issues.
 
6X-60-02 – 3x for 10min – Step 7 min depth not reached – Seeing faults on a few programs. Faulting out at about -27.1 to -27.2mm. Tolerance was set at -27mm. No changes were made but if issue is consistent going forward we can look into opening up step 7 a lite bit with caution.
 
6Y-180-02 – Was on gun #2 when I got here. Saw tool had a few depth gradient faults. Also noticed analog depth offset changed 2mm when gun swapped which corresponded with depth gradient faults. Sensor was tight and working right. Adjusted depth gradient for program 12, 8, 4, 11, 10 and 9. Back on gun #1. Monitor.
 
8G-420-01 – Cross member missing nuts – Seems our front pan issue has now migrated over to #3 CM. There were 6 parts that came out missing nuts tonight. Dave will be working on installing the same error proofing switch on this press as we did on the front pan press. This will send a fault and detect when a nut is missing. As for whats cuasing it we are unsure. VOME Doug Rehkopf is writing us a repair procedure that will give us a good way to repair these nuts with the tools we have on hand. Will follow keep following up on that.
 
7G-70-L02 – BT2 faults – 7x 45min – Screw was not making it out to gun. Manually escaped and blew screws and could not get them to gun. EL swapped guns thinking this would fix issue. Issue followed to gun #2. Called PF to check feed tube. When we went in and jiggled the tube the screw broke free and fed to the gun. Swapped to back-up tube (which was not ready).

I wrote a work order A79916404 to have the tinners fabricate and install some sort of diffuser for the ventilation unit over door 127.  The old diffuser was damaged and removed by central maintenance back some time ago.   The open vent blows out so much concentrated air we are afraid the air will blow the new door out of track.   The air flow is taking the path of least resistance and blowing all the air out of the open vent.  I  think I would try partially blocking the opening on the side closest to the door thus sending more air around to the other doors.

I am being told this is the last OLD style assembly we have as well so we are exposed there. Will follow up with Tyner in the AM about locating/expediting parts.
 
8G-420-01 - #3 CM REO press switch – New error proofing is working very well on SWB units. It immediately catches a dry fire situation. LWB is not working at all and is making bad parts. We read up on the switch but were not sure how to adjust it and did not want to ruin any successful adjustments made for SWB. KUKA is aware and the guy that set it up will be here in the AM to configure the switch for LWB. Also investigated the press itself trying to figure out why we are having the dry fires. Manually fed a nut and extended the placement arm 3 times and one of those times the nut came out crooked. This could be the issue. Need to verify press is looking for nut present all the way up until the ram fires. Also wouldn’t hurt to get a new arm in there. We never had issues on this press until we put the once bent-now straightened arm on the press. Will get with Tyner about getting more arms and jaws in.

8X-90-06 – Head too low – 2x for 1hr5min – 160072 setter was swapped Saturday night. Ran fine all day today. Around start-up tonight it went bad quickly. With only 7k cycles at 61.5kn we started getting Rivmon faults, rivets were sitting very high, tool was not getting up to speed, home offset was drifting and tool was not returning home. Called TM to swap setter. That took a while…during the process TM over-torqued setter nut with clicker wrench. When we went to calibrate and home the tool the punch would not travel freely because the nuts was compressing the collar. Had TM loosen nut and re-torque properly and issues went away. Had to re-teach Rivmon after units were verified. Setter is in TM shop. Henrob will be tasked with going through it tomorrow morning to figure out what is wrong with it.
 
8Y-40-01 – Feed faults- 13x for 38min – GBSD had 195k cycles on it. EL called TM to change GBSD. TM attempted to fix it on the tool to keep it running instead. Unsuccessful so they swapped it. Feed faults continued. After continuing to try and troubleshoot and reset fault it was noticed that TM installed nose backwards during swap which was preventing rivets from feeding. Fixed nose and tool ran for a lite bit. Shory after feed faults began again. EL kept resetting to keep it limping until lunch. TMs went and swapped GBSD and nose again at approx. 400 cycles during lunch and issues went away. Found new GBSD nose switch was set too far out. Working on a plan for a better rebuild process and giving the toolmakers all the information and coaching they need to do a better job with rebuilds.
 
8Y-20-02 – Feed faults – 2x for 22min – EL could not get fault to reset. TM came and swapped GBSD and faults went away. GBSD had 18k cycles on it. Monitor rivet present cable if issues persist.
 
7L-40-R01 – Rivmon material too soft – 5x for 10min – For some reason error warning thresholds on a few spots were reset. Set everything back up and issues went away.
 
7L-30-R03 – Gun #1 – Feed faults – 5x for 10min – EL called for TM to do GBSD swap. GBSD was at 78k cycles.
 
6Y-180-02 – Forgot to swap back to primary since cable change. Will be on gun #1 for start up validation.
 
6X-180-02 – Rivet too far inboard on windshield opening causing a split in the metal. Spot 7V774-12R was moved outboard a bit. Cutoff rotation is #9753.
 
8G-420-01 – REO M10 SPAC press – Pressurized not on – 4 x for 40min – Press not reading pressurized intermitteny. Also not punching out slugs hardly at all. TM went and found the tapered pin we put in the other night had snapped off on the end (no more of that). They replaced the pin and tool started running better. Operator said slug issue is gone and she has not had any missing nuts as far as she knows. Seems new feed arm may be working. TM also noted that the lockout pin for the press is bent badly so they could not insert it into the ram. They had to go fabricate one to work on it. Need to follow up on that.
 
7G-70-L02 – Step 2 faults – 8x for 2hr15min – Both gun #1 and gun #2 wouldn’t advance at all. EL reported dress pack was destroyed this morning at start-up because we did not route it back right after our feed tube run this weekend. When dress was put back together signal cable was pinched and bent sharply. Ran a quick bypass from base of robot to gun and stepped robot through and found the tool ran fine. Did not have matching 10M cable for tool but had a lone 11M laying in satellite crib. Ran it externally which took a while and tool ran rest of shift without issue. Turns out the 11M was a blessing in disguise because they needed more length to run it better. Writing work order to replace dress and run cable internally over the weekend.
 
7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 6x for 1hr3min – EL tried to limp but couldn’t get tool to run. Called TM over to swap feeder. After swapping feeder EL had issues getting robot to resume production. Had to teach it back home, run home I/O, release part from EE and clear shift registers. This took up a majority of the time.
 
5B-50-03 – Feed fault – 2x for 9min – GBSD and nose were full of adhesive. Took off to swap and found punch was chipped up which was chewing the tape keeping it from feeding. Swapped GBSD, nose and punch. GBSD/nose at 21K and punch was at 406K cycles.

As the operator unloads each one or two, the conveyor will index forward so the next part can be unloaded.  Once all parts are unloaded, the robot will drop 4 more parts to the conveyor and the process starts again.  The night shift operator likes 4 parts at a time best.  Still have a little housekeeping to do, like add a smaller reflector to the retroreflective photo eye we added.  I will clean it up tonight.  It ran after lunch to the end shift indexing.

Tried to go to back-up tube but found it was about 10in too short to be used. EL zip tied the IGUS in place to release tension on tube and screws were able to feed without issue.

8X-90-06 – Setter swap – It was realized that Monday night when we had our setter breakdown the wrong setter was installed. Should have been a 160072 but the TMs put a 250072 on the tool. Luckily since it is a short stroke tool it ran. We swapped to a 160072 between shifts and ran 1 LWB and 1 SWB for validation. No Rivmon changes were needed. First SWB rotation is #1139 and first LWB rotation is #1140. Have inspectors check.
 
Rotation #0877 – Roof was damaged somehow. Attempting to repair in heavy metal. The front RH side of room was buckled up. I was told we sent units last week with pop rivets without issue. Need to follow up on that because as of now I was under the impression pop rivets would not work on the roof.
 
6Y-180-02 – Broken jaw and bit on gun #1. Gun swapped. Between shifts TMs swapped head assembly and bit between shifts. Paul Glardon is going to touch up robot programs on gun #1 between shifts today. That is the only thing I can think of that would be causing all these bit and jaw failures on this tool. Gun #2 works fine.
 
7G-10-R03 – Having issues with punch coming loose on RH side now. TMs called to tighten punch. Contacted Henrob asking them to deep dive the stud tools because we have had way too much trouble with them.

Had to release from AVS once again.  Also had to write the correct data to the skid.  The next unit the robot picked up was a SWB but there was a LWB skid in 6S-50.

7K-30-R05 – Step 2 max time exceeded – Was on gun #2. Between shifts swapped to gun #1 to try and figure out whats going on. Found flow control set to 0 bar.

7G-70-L02 – Step 4 internal torque faults – Seeing weird torque spikes in step 4 (shouldn’t even be monitoring torque). Had TMs change transducer on gun #1 between shifts to see if it would fix issue. This leaves 1 transducer left in the plant. Monitor at start-up for improvement.

6X190-6 Hot swapped setter for 1 million cycle rebuild. Punch and die were over 950k on both and were replaced. This setters timing was off from the factory creating an ABS fault that was corrected by timing the setter. This setter was difficult to remove due to water leaking on the frame creating some rust.

 ",17,17,0,,,0,0,0,"Ethan Pemberton from ATI visited us on Friday and a formal report from him is to follow.  He and our electricians were able to find a few issues.  They found one module with a broken bushing and replaced it.  Found one module that did not have the crown pin conversion.  This is likely a module that has been installed after tool installation at KTP so its something to look at before installing new modules.  Also found a kink in an air supply hose which was replaced and re-routed.  Ethan said that the absolute minimum air pressure recommended for the locking mechanism is 60 psi.  Our robots were at 60 +/- a few psi so we increased robot air pressures to 70psi.  Monitor pressure at startup as these pressures were adjusted when the cells weren't running production.  They also used the robot alignment aid and touched up all tool change approach points on the LHBS.

8Y-10-06 – Step 15 min depth/max time – 4x for 6min – Swapped pretty much right at start up. Faults only on programs 2 and 12. EL was instructed to touch-up between shifts. Doesn’t look like it was accomplished because the tool is still on back-up. Dayshift follow up needed.
 
#1 – 7B-10-R01 – Nut not present on ram – 20x for 3.5hr – Still seeing issues that were seen on day-shift. Adjusted the nut present sensor on tube to alleviate some pressure off the nuts as they are dropping into the head. This seemed to help for a while but eventually faulted again. Looked at 558 press and noticed the angle of the chute feeding into the jaws is not as severe thus less gravity fed pressure on the nuts. May need to look at adjusting the angle of the chuting when the line goes down. Also noticed TMs had filed down the pin that keeps the nut held back.

8Y-10-05 – Communication locked up again. Went to do offset and just sat there. Did manually offset and sent to job and it just sat there again. Swapped to gun #2 and did the same thing. Found analog depth sensor on gun #1 was out of adjustment. Fixed that and put back on gun #1. Sat there again. Sent robot back home and powered down the Weber and robot controller. Did gun swap again and gun #2 did its offset and ran a job without issue. Did a swap back to gun #1. Gun #1 did its offset and ran a job without issue. Gun #1 programs have now been touched up on both LWB  and SWB. Have no clue whats going on with the communication issue. Checked all connections and cables and all seemed good. Robot appears to be waiting for “tool fully open” Weber is indicating the tool is “home”/open. But for whatever reason he robot isn’t seeing it. Cycle power fixed issue but have a feeling something else is going on.
 
6X-20-03 – Had “pusher back” fault once line was put in auto. EL went in and found rvt in esc sensor dangling. This was not causing the issue but it had fallen out of mag. TM came and took escapement apart and put sensor back in. Still had pusher back faults. Feedstick was swapped over weekend. Tried to remove feedstick to troubleshoot and it was jammed on the nose. Had to fight to get it off. Finally got it off and everything looked okay and pusher moved as it should when valved. Put back together and sent in. Same fault. Swapped feedstick. New feedstick seemed to fit better. Did not have to fight to get it on or off. Sent back in. Same fault. Went in and checked cables and found the communication cable from the harting connection point to the I/O block was loose. Tool was getting signal to fire pusher but was not receiving. Once cable was tightened tool ran fine. Other feedstick is most likely fine.

#2 6X-90-04 – Rivmon head too high – 10x for 40min – Carryover faults from velocity adjustments made. Running so many different models does not allow us to capture all spots when we teach and unless the next shift EL is fully aligned it can cause so confusion.

We noticed two things.  1) the lighting has changed, it is darker in the area now with the plastic covering the area for roof repairs and 2)  every long Lincoln right rear quarter panel has scuff marks around the top of the wheel hose opening.   When we wiped off the scuff marks, the long Lincolns would hem without issue, but we don’t want to wipe every quarter panel.   We also added an LED flood light to the right side of sta 200, to add more light on the subject.  This also has helped, no failed long Lincolns since.

8Y10-6 did not go well at start up. We need to touch up the program on the SWB model last two screw programs 6 and 7. They were getting a Max Torque exceeded step 14 on both programs. 
 
6Y180-2 went on back up at 630pm due to a broken bit and within 20 minutes the other broke. Had to stop the line and replaced them both. Left it on gun 2 until 10pm and then swapped to gun 1. This could use some program touch up as well…..maybe.

8Y-10-06 – Max torque step 14 on programs 6 and 7. Was on gun #2 when I got here. EL touching up programs 6 and 7 and putting back on primary between shifts. Inspectors finding screws not seated that aren’t suspect. Also ran out of screws for a bit on 10-05 and 10-06 which faults the unit out for BT3 faults.

Nights – Snyder
#1 8Y-10-06 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 15x for 31min – Spent nearly the entire night at this tool. When I got here it was on gun #2 (still faulting sporadically and still not seating screws). We had the afternoon guys put on gun #1 before they left but it faulted 9 jobs in a row so it was swapped again. Just about at lunch I had EL put back on gun 1. We made almost 30 parameter adjustments to a few programs that seemed to work very well. We were able to run on gun #1 the rest of the shift with almost no faults and some minor adjustments. Inspectors noted improvement of the non-seated screws with only 2 or 3 the entire night. We focused on those spots and took care of that issue as far as we were aware. EL also touched up spot 1 on SWB and 11 on LWB because it appeared to be going in at an angle. Continue to have inspectors monitor for high screws.
 
8Y-10-05 – Step 14 max torque exceeded – Between shifts TMs inspected gun. Found bit burnt up and found the jaws were set too tight not allowing the screw to sit in the nose properly.
 
8F-120-03 – Feed faults – Had a few feed faults throughout shift. Had TMs check gun between shifts. GBSD was at 250K so we went ahead and did a swap.
 
5C-310-02 – TM replaced hem roller due to bad bearings. Roller was loose and felt rough. New roller 6170000023014/K19-1013793774 has been ordered to replace one used ($706.67).

Appeared nozzle was damaged are partial clogged due to sealer spraying off at an angle.  Pipefitter replaced the nozzle, but the sealer still sprayed off location.  Next we replaced the nozzle adapter with the same result.  Purged the sealer with the nozzle and without.  Swapped pumps and swapped barrels.  Sealer still sprayed sideways.  Problem may be in the valve, but we did not have the correct valve in stock.  Next step was to reprogram the sealer path and put the nozzle closer to the part.  Paul Glardon made the changes and in places, laid the nozzle on the part.  After shift did everything again we did earlier, but sealer is spraying straight now.  Ran one part to verify.  Copied programs back to their original names.    Ford’s only.  Xseal_U553 is the Glardon back up program with the nozzle on the part.

Both the joining inspectors and the CMM inspectors have been instructed to do a swap around 6:30p every night.  And sometimes these swaps take place at the same time.  Apparently the PLC logic can’t handle two swaps simultaneously.  I think two things need to happen, 1) joining inspectors and CMM inspectors swap units at different times, say 1 hour apart,  and communicate with each other, 2) CEC changes the logic so that two simultaneously swaps are not permitted.  ",,,"Nights – Snyder

#2 7K-30-L01 – Bad home offset/abs pos invalid – 10x for 1hr15min – See 4D.
 
#3 7X-20-L01 (Gun #2) – Head too low – 5x for 22min – One of the faults was during the setter debacle in 7K-30 so there was additional downtime. End distance nominal was riding on upper tolerance band on spots 63, 93 and 94. Adjusted and verfieid rivets. No more issues.
 
8X-70-04 – Adhesive touch-up – Inspector noted a ~3in skip on LWB rear pan area only. Checked numerous things but ended up finding robot program was too close and wiping the adhesive from the part as opposed to putting it on. Touched up and skip went away.
 
6Y-180-03 – Hold down device not RET – EL could not do eject. Swapped to gun #2 and could get it to run. Found active jaw valve was manually triggered. Closed jaw and tool ran. Swapped back to gun #1. Same issue with it not being able to retract. Found hold down air regulator turned down to 1 bar. Set at recommended 4 bar and tool ran fine.
 
#1 7B-10-R01 – Nitrogen low pressure switch not on – 2xf for 2hr51min – See 4D for first 2 hours. Later in shift had nitrogen pressure switch break off due to orientation being changed between shifts and it did not clear robot during production.
 
Monitored liftgate adhesive throughout shift and checked with inspector for teardown results. All is well.","The fault on the floor pan sheer was for latch cylinder #1 not advanced but it was in fact for latch cylinder #2 not advanced.  Grant Barnet changed the logic.  Checked the latch cylinder for ram #2 and it is slower than ram #1 but makes in the 1.5 seconds for the fault timer.   We added a little oil to the cylinder to see if that will help speed it.  I checked the one that was replaced and it too appears to be slow to advance but it hard to compare the two.  With one of the machine and one on the bench.   I opted not to change the #2 latch cylinder as of yet.   ","B pillar Spac nut machine never started up.  The low pressure switch was not on and high pressure switch was still on were the faults, but the pressure switch was reading correctly.  Pipefitter said he only replaced a leaking nitrogen fitting on the machine.  We checked the cables, the I/O block,  etc. Could not find anything wrong.  Pipefitter said he thought a logic change was made due to the machine bleeding off, so we started looking for at the logic.  Later we found out the pressure switch was inverted and the rep working with him changed the display on the switch.  That got us looking at the switch.  Comparing the switch parameters with the Spac nut machine beside it, they were different.  Found several parameter different including the NO and NC states of the outputs.  We believe they were changed while changing the direction of the display.  A few hours later, when we switched from building left sides to right sides, the inverted switch crashed into the robot end effector breaking the connector off the switch.

Subject: Safety Follow-ups
Importance: High
 
Andrew asked me to follow-up with the ME’s on two safety items:
Are you aware of any door safety edges in your respective area that are not operational?
Are you aware of any issues with acetylene regulators as used by millwrights?  I am thinking that there may have been an issue with fitting type on Stores acetylene tanks that required different regulators.  Please verify with your MW’s that the correct regulators are used on their oxygen/acetylene cutting torch set-ups.
 
We will discuss in additional detail during the ME meeting tomorrow.  Thanks

#1 6X-20-06 – Escapement not at A – 2x for 43min – Escapement cylinder binding not making esc at A position switch. EL were able to reset fault for multiple rivets and have TM clear that to keep running. TM swapped magazine between shifts. Mag only had 48k cycles on it. Once disassembled we did not see any issues with magazine. It was relatively clean and escapement gate did not have any marks or burrs on it. Monitor.
 
#10 7K-40-R02 – Step 15 max time exceeded – 4x for 9min – Repeated faults on both LWB and SWB program 1,2,11,12. EL went in and verified robot position. Found screw was clipping clearance hole on all spots causing strip outs. Adjust program and had no more issues.
 
8Y-10-06 – Step 15 max time exceeded – 3x for 6min – Bit broken. EL kept trying to run tool. Told him to stop and check to see what was wrong. Once broken bit was found we swapped guns and ran fine rest of shift. TM replacing bit and checking head assembly for damage between shfits.
 
8Y-20-05 – Head too high – 2x for 5min – There was a loose screw on the UB from the issue in station 10. The gun attempted to rivet on top of the screw twice thus giving Rivmon faults. EL went to just clear fault with it being over 2mm out of tolerance. Coached him on how to properly deal with Rivmon faults and explained the risk of “just clearing” faults from the Henrob and not verifying the are good.
 
7K-30-L05 – BT3 not measured – 4x for 6min – Issue has been lingering for the past day or so. Screw is making it to gun so investigated why we are seeing faults. Found BT3 cable very loose. Tightened. Monitor to see if this fixes issue.
 
6Y-180-04 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 5x for 10min – No screw in nose. EL valved brake a few times and screw fell. TM are disassembling brake and inspecting/cleaning it between shifts.
 
6Y-180-02 – Marty White and Paul Glardon are doing an study. Want to keep on gun #2 for the rest of the week and see if we have the same issues with bits breaking and whatnot as we do on gun #1. Gun #1 is fully functional and ready to be used as a hot swap if gun #2 has issues.
 
8Y-110-02 – Encoder and drive faults – Still getting sporadic encoder and drive faults on Henrob. J3 to gun encoder cable has already been changed. Next step will be to run cable from base of robot to J3 to see if it resolves issue. We did not have time to complete this tonight. It is not causing extensive downtime but if it gets worse we should try that.
 
#2 7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 3x for 1hr11min – All TM’s were tied up on other issues. When they got there they cleared studs from head and tool ran. Monitor for continued SNT issues.

#6 6X-60-02 – Step 2 max time exceeded – 4x for 15min – Head assembly was repaired/replaced between shifts. When we went to put back on gun #1 to verify it was retrying, faulting and shooting sparks. Found hold down foot was bent and rubbing on bit. Also found linear bearings very loose. Had to align and tighten. We were able to run validation units. Good to go.
 
#8 6Y-180-01- Step 2 max time exceeded – 12x for 14min – Faults only on gun #1 on program 5 generally. Swapped to gun #2 to see if issue followed and it did not. Between shifts TM went and PM’d and aligned gun. Found bearings loose and out of alignment. Monitor at start-up.

8F-125-01 – Fought issue with buttons breaking off of black powdercoated steel reinformcent brackets all night. Primarily on one spot 8V706-05-L. Did not appear button was forming at all. Decreased velocity. Did not help. Increased velocity. Did not help. Checked robot program. All was good. Checked die. All was good. Scotch brite pad to die to clean it up and prevent potential sticking. No better. Changed stock bins. No better. Changed spool (was noted issue started after spool change). No better. We would run 3 good parts and then get 3 bad parts. Was not consistent but usually was the one spot. Eventually went back and turned velocity down again (290 to 280mm/s) and we were able to run 12 parts in a row that were good which we hadn’t done all night. Repair were adding pop-rivet on units that came out with bad buttons.
 
Unit in light repair with roof ditch pop rivets showed up. Repair looked pretty bad. Pop rivets on top of rivets in some locations. Pop rivet was well seated and back side looked as if it was clamped well so we bought off.
 
Unit in heavy repair with A-pillar repair mess. Not quite sure what was started there and what the direction was but we set it aside for day-shift to finish up. I don’t see how we are going to adequately repair it.

7G-70-R01 – 2x for 28min – Issue on days during gun swap. Robot collision during swap.

Takes quite a while to recover from collision and then the Weber loses its mind because it doesn’t know its docked to the robot due to the swap being interrupted. James French adjusted pick-up program and is curreny working on adjusting it for gun #2 (same issue). Should be on gun #1 and good to go as well. Gun itself is fine as far as I can see.

8Y10-6 Gun 2 program touched up between shifts on long and short. We did not copy robot positional data over to gun 1. Consulted with Marty White and he did not feel it was a good idea even though the guns should be the same, they may not be. Marty started building a reference point program for the guns to verify when we starting having issues to see if anything has moved on the guns. At start up we started faulting on the first two steps of the LWB model with a ""Spindle stroke front end reached"" fault indicating the the gun traveled farther than it should have. We shifted the taught points 2mm into the pan which cleared up the faults and ran for about half an hour then started getting max time exceeded faults on the SWB model on the 3rd screw. Gun was swapped before I got there and it immediately jammed, the Weber controller requested a manual clear screw at nose but we could not get it to open. Had the Toolmakers swap the head assembly which fixed the jamming. Put back in auto and ran. Both guns need more programming help with an above average programmer. 
 
7G70R-1 on gun 1 at start up but was grinding the bit so the program was touched up again and corrected this issue. 
 
6Y180-4 faulted with a BT2 not measured fault and the gun was swapped before I got there and this did not correct the fault. We pulled the feed tube at the BT2 switch and manually shot a screw which came through as expected. Put back in auto and got a BT3 not measured. Shuffled the screws prior to the escapement in the feeder and put back in auto and ran.

Weber test stand- Moved back into its home location at the 480v plug and connected all cables, replaced shaker assembly in the feeder that was taken to get another cell running during a breakdown and powered up the stand.

Going to need some help with this. We have air on the stand but need a feed tube installed. If we can get the power panel on the feeder operating and a feed tube we'll be ready to start testing.

8Y10-6 Replaced gun 1 with a new Weber. It will be in the TM shop and we will start rebuilding it on Monday with Weber support. The rebuild will be the full 1 million cycle. This will be one of the units we'll use for hot swaps that will begin very soon. I plan to have 4 units that we can use for hot swapping, 2 RH and 2 LH. This will allow us to complete all of the gun 1 units over a 9 week period. As we begin this swap out we are going to start moving all of the guns over to gun 2 to run for our new month to month swap program. Mitch and I have discussed this and agree it's a good idea to start putting some miles on gun 2. We are going to need a more detailed reporting system in FIS that will tell us when gun 2 is swapped out.

Worked with Percpetron and Valiant all day on the tailgate decking issue.   The lower LH pillar sensor was changed.   No help.

I turned the backup scheme back off at station 30 for troubleshooting. We found a few things wrong. One of them was the sensor was not aimed and the other was there was no maintenance scheme in the setting. After we did that we were able to follow the procedure to aim it. You could turn the backup scheme back on if needed. We only had one unit to try it out so BE AWARE!

Logic needs to be changed to automatically tag units as suspect whenever skip once or skip remaining is used.

Checked, chain tension perfect",,"On Weber robots only, I think we should add logic to automatically set the unit as suspect when the one of the Weber robots is manually set cycle complete thru the panel view.  The issue arises when a Weber gun fails while on a job and the gun has to be swapped.  Electricians used skip remaining to bring the gun to maintenance position, then abort all and proceed with a gun change.  Fast fault recovery is then lost.   So, the unit has to be set cycle complete and as suspect and start new on the next unit or from the robot I/F screen, turn the screw gun off and let the robot move thru its program and turn screw back on at the correct step.   This sets the unit as suspect, but the electrician needs to remember when to turn the screw gun on.  If the unit is set cycle complete, we are relying on the electrician to remember to set the unit as suspect before releasing it from the station.

#3 – 8Y-10-06 – 7x for 25min – Replaced valve pack on gun #1. Still having issues retracting and we have went through everything else. It is a new gun. Curreny on gun #1 and ejecting screws like it should.
 
#9 – 7X-20-L01 – Head too low – 4x for 9min – Adjusted Rivmon end distance nominal on spot 96. Inspector verified.
 
#10 – 6X-80-03 – Head too low – 3x for 7min – Adjusted Rivmon end distance nominal on spot 32. Inspector verified.
 
7X-20-L02 – Head too low – 2x for 6min – Adjusted Rivmon end distance nominal on spot 3 and 64. Inspector verified.
 
7L-30-L04 – Head too low – 2x for 5min – Adjusted Rivmon end distance nominal on gun #2 all spots. They were just barely riding on the high side. Inspector verified.
 
#1 – 5B-40-04 – Head too low – 8x for 32min – EL adjusted velocity due to inspector reporting rivet was nearing low end of spec. In doing so he didn’t not teach Rivmon which caused faults and confusion. Inspector verified rivet and Rivmon was put in teach.
 
#6 – 5B-40-04 – Speed too high – 5x for 21min – EL adjusted velocity out of tool max speed range. He did not know what fault meant so there were parts shipped missing rivets due to using “skip once.” Took a while to clear suspect parts and get everything back in order. Paul Bishop now understands what happened.
 
7G-70-R01 (gun #1) – Step 1 internal torque faults – Getting repeated internal torque faults. EL was able to reset to keep it limping but it progressively got worse. Eventually started failing torque calibration before it ran. EL went in and we checked if transducer was tight. There was quite a bit of slop in the connector. Changed transducer and faults have subsided for now.
 
6Y-90-08/6Y-90-07 – Trialed the 3D printer setter motor cover on 6Y-90-08 (highest force in shop). First part the cover was smashed in the lift-gate opening causing it to break and fly off. Will be discussing with Henrob if we can shorten the spaces on the setter to get us clearance.

ASI had to power down the C02 processor panel to re-route some conduit.  Once they finished we reset the safety circuit and made sure we could get auto mode.  Also manually moved the elevator and a couple of the lift tables to prove it would move.  However, there is no room between C02 and framer to move a unit so we couldn't cycle it in auto.  Needs proven out.
 
ASI was also working installing conveyor basket on the south end of 7G and are still working there as I type this.

Worked with Perceptron at 6X-140.  Narrowed window for Perceptron to determine if a single sensor is giving incorrect/false measurment.

Perceptron had seen that on all of the roofs that weren't placed correctly that this data showed >5 so they have changed the threshold to 3.

Nights – Snyder
6X-180-01 – EL noticed setter shot gunning. Pulled out to maintenance found the GBSD and nose were full of adhesive. Called TM over to change GBSD. Once we pulled GBSD off found punch was extremely chewed up from the nose bearings being seized up due to adhesive being in nose. Changed punch and GBSD which both had 120k cycles on it. Root cause of the adhesive build up is short trim flange on DOP coming from stamping causing the nose to rivet on adhesive bead as opposed to metal. We lost at least 20min that doesn’t show up in FIS.
 
7A-30-01 – Dock tube sensor – 1x for 47min – Rivets jammed in dock causing them to backfill to sensor. Robot doing “dance” because it was waiting on mag fill complete. Had PF pull tube and clear rivets as well as clear rivets from dock. After this mag was filled and tool ran.

We have some logic changes testing on the right side of sta 85 U/B main.  Involves the clamping sequence and the part present switches for the bracket stud part.  Once the fixture clamping sequence begins, we now hold the part present switches in place until the bracket stud clamp is closed and part present is still made.  Then we actuate the arm and move the part present switches out of the way.  Did this on both LWB and SWB models.  No issues so far.  Ran it all night.  Will put it in the left side fixture logic Tuesday.  I believe we will still need to lengthen the locating pin that helps hold the part in position.

7B-110-14 – Max force exceeded – 17x – Force was just barely outside of tolerances. Had to reteach force envelope curve and faults went away. Gradually increasing force high limit did not seem to work. Tool reports out faulted for both LH and RH applications. Even if we are only running LH the fault stays latched and shows as faulted for RH until a RH part is ran even if we are running dozens of LH parts. So fault time and data is quit exaggerated.

Went over and noticed the tape was under pulled causing the faults. Increased the sprocket pressure. This made issue worse because we went too far. Backed it down. Ran for a good 45min to an hour with no issues. Faulted again. Checked punch and found it was slighy mushroomed. New punch installed. Ran for about a half hour with no issues then faulted again. Tape was all chewed up looked to be over pulling. Noticed rivet present cable was losing the rivet while riveting sometimes. Tried ruling rivet present cable out wiggled cable every way possible and couldn’t get it to turn off. Sent back in. Ran for a bit but faulted again. Hard to believe a 3rd GBSD was bad on the tool in the same day but we swapped after production anyway. Ran about 20 rivets into a coupon to verify tape looked good and it did.

Took apart between shifts and found the bit was seized up in the bit adaptor. Once we got it out we found the bit was bent at the quick connect. Put new bit in and screw still would not feed fully to the nose. Appeared baffle wasn’t opening all the way. Changed head assembly (possibly damaged due to bent bit).

We pulled a 250072 setter out of shop that had a green rebuilt tag for 5-29-18. When we installed it we were able to home and calibrate okay but once we ran a validation part we noticed something was wrong because the setter had a pretty bad grinding noise while running. Went and got a brand new setter out of sat crib and installed it with no issues. Put the suspect setter on test stand and found that it indeed made the same noises while running on test stand.

Setter motor cover trial (clearances checked and passed on 19 tools) – 8Y-90-01, 6X-160-01, 6X-160-02, 6Y-100-05, 6Y-100-06, 6X-90-03, 6X-140-04, 6Y-150-05, 6Y-150-06, 8X-90-05, 8X-90-06, 8Y-10-03, 8Y-10-04, 8Y-90-02, 8Y-90-03, 8Y-90-04, 6X-90-04, 6X-160-03, 6X-140-03. This completes all tools over 65kn on underbody main, underbody respot, framing main (except station 20) and framing respot. Will need to schedule jobs to check clearances in station 20 on the weekend. No real good way to install test block and watch it during production. Same goes for bodysides. May just test them individually as they become due for setter swaps and go from there. As of now we have 32 tools that have been checked and pass. This should get us off to a good start on implementing the black setters.
 
#3 – 6X-170-04 – Nose switch fault – 3x for 14min – EL reset fault and kept it running through shift. Swapped GBSD and nose between shifts. Showed zero on hand. Had 2 in stacker. Ordered 3 more for $9653.50 each so we will have 4 back-up.
 
8Y-110-02 – Had a few more encoder/drive errors. Back to the drawing board.
 
8Y-10-05 – Had some step 14 max time faults on one job and EL swapped gun. TM checked out gun #1 between shifts. Did not see anything to be concerned about. On gun #1…monitor.
 
7K-50-R06 – Head too low – 3x for 4min – faults on spots 1 and 31. Adjusted end distance nominal.
 
7L-50-R06 – Nose switch fault – 3x for 6min – EL reset fault and tool ran. This tool usually burns through a punch and GBSD once every 2 weeks. Not quite sure why. Going to do a study and see if we can install an air nose GBSD on tool.
 
6X-60-02 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 3x for 8min – Appears we had a screw feed issue followed by a double feed. Did not repeat itself.
 
6Y-180-02 – Step 14 and 15 max time exceeded – Faulting on numerous programs. Got worse. Stripped out bit. Swapped to gun #2. TM PM’d and replaced bit on gun #1 between shifts.
 
6Y-80-10 – Step 7 min depth not reached – 3x for 7min – Faulting on program 3. Faulting out at -24.3mm to -24.5mm. Step 7 min depth set at -24mm. Opened up tolerance. 
 
#1 – 7B-110-14 – Clinch controller fault – 2x for 3hr28min – Had a force < min force fault at about 6:15pm that did not show cleared until 9:40pm. I suspect this fault was latched due to us only running one side. Did investigate later in shift and made some parameter adjustments to accommodate the lower force readings we were seeing. Should be good.
 
7A-20-13 – Tool probe A position – 5x for 32min – EL was able to reset fault and tool ran. Magazine shows 7k cycles on it. Went in with EL and did not see anything blatany wrong. Will monitor tonight and see if the probe position switch needs adjustment.
 
9A-40-02 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 1x for 22min – Fault showed up after a BT5 fault in feeder. Seems it was reset and told there was a screw and there wasn’t. Once it was back in sequence tool ran fine.
 
8F-130-01 – Slugs on rear ladder – Got a call from production that they were seeing ladders with slugs in SPAC nuts. TM worked on press between shifts and replaced spring in punch assembly.",,,"Had the RH marriage tool tray drift off location again today. It was off far enough to damage units. The RH front belt is walkiing off of the shiv and was chewing on the belt. Forced it into slow speed to get through the shift.  Millwrights made a slight adjustment to the south side belt take up on the right hand marriage tool tray to get the belt walking back toward the center.  Need to monitor the belt thru the inspection window frequently.  We left it running in slow speed for now.  Millwrights inspected the left side marriage for a similar condition but reported both belts were tracking in the center.
 ",,,"Looked at front door line robot 40R03 end effector.  According to Paul Bishop, that fault occurs after the part has been picked, operations are complete and is waiting to drop off.  We went thru all the cords and connections again.  Founding nothing new.

9C230-1W blew nut stopper apart bending screws and bending hold arm. Joe Jackey changed the logic to keep on pushing when the press did not see a nut claiming it was cocking in the nut holder, this was root cause for the stopper to blow out. Directed Joe to undue his changes, replaced nut stopper and will replace the arm between shifts. Nut sensor was most likely not reading correcy from the nut stopper being installed upside down with the nut reading window minimized. Has been running without faults since 1030am.

8X-85-04 – Picked completed on all units but 1304 and 1305. Units hit T23 faster than expected so those will need to be picked up on metal line when they arrive.
 
6X-40-05 – Setter swap – The anticipation was killing me. I was losing sleep. I couldn’t contain myself. I installed a brand new shiny black setter on this tool tonight. Really I swapped it tonight because I wanted it to be good and validated and the weekend doesn’t allow that. Rivets were quite deep. Backed off velocity on all spots. 1353 will be the first rotation the inspector needs to thoroughly check.
 
6Y-180-02 – Put back on gun #2 at 11 to validate between shift work. Ran fine.
 
7G-70-L01 – Gun #2 running poorly. Faulting on step 7 on almost all programs. Switched to gun #1 to complete shift. Between shifts went to check gun. Found everything was mechanically okay. Screw was making it to nose fine. Dug deeper into faults and realized depth tolerance in step 7 were set pretty tight and we were faulting just outside the window. They had to have been changed because they were all very random numbers. Adjusted depth tolerances on all programs. Ran some validation parts and got some step 14 max time exceeded faults. Went in to find quite a few programs were quite a bit off location completely missing the clearance hole. Touched up robot positions and ran 3 validation parts. Monitor.

9B-250-02 – TOX controller – Had about 40min downtime tonight on a TOX controller. It has been popping up in FIS for the past few days. Finally got to see what was going on today. In mid cycle full auto the controller locks up and displays a “wrong mode” error. This normally shows up when you are trying to manually run a program and the TOX is in automatic mode. When you put it all in manual and try to re-home and reference the tool all you get is the same error message. The only way we were able to get it to run was to cycle power. Once power was cycled the tool resumed its cycle like nothing happened. I have emailed TOX support Rick Gardner and Chris Turchch asking them to look into why the controller would display this message in auto.

#1 – 6Y-80-09 – 4x for 1hr24min – Really only 3 occurrances for 15min. Gun was swapped due to head sticking when trying to eject. Swapped back to gun 2 at end of shift and stopped in middle of offset/eject program to PM which latched fault. TM cleaned adhesive off of head assembly and cleared multiple screws from head. Good to run.
 
#3 – 6X-60-01 – 1x for 21min – Not really a fault. Was on gun #1 when I got here. Swapped to gun #2 to touch up both LWB and SWB programs. Line stopped running and filled up before we could get to a LWB. SWB found multiple programs that were off and at angles. SWB is touched up but need to do LWB. Left on gun #1 until LWB could be stepped through.

Nights – Snyder
#5 – 6Y-110-02 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 9x for 30min – Swapped to gun #2 at 11pm. Gun didn’t need any PM. Was functioning fine but having trouble achieving specified depth tolerances in step 15. Was only 0.1mm out. Adjusted depth from -1.0 to -1.2mm on programs 20-22. Program 19 was hitting at -1.3mm so we increased torque from 8nm to 8.5nm which enabled us to hit -1.0 to -0.8mm consisteny without issue. On gun #2 and running well. Monitor and make changes to work with material by checking step result data.
 
#7 – 8Y-10-06 – Was on gun #2. Reported spot #2 on LWB needed touched up. Tried swapping to gun #2 at 11pm to see what exacy we needed to do but ended up finding the head assembly was pretty well destroyed. Broken bit and busted jaws. Took us a minute to get gun back out to swap. Put back on gun #1. TM replacing head assembly and giving linear bearing alignment a once-over between shifts.
 
7K-20-R06 – Head too low – 3x for 11min – Gun #2 spots 31-34 nominal end distance were trending high. Made adjustments. Closed.

It was only out by less than 100 counts so we just retaught the position.,"Front floor pan dropping auto at the beginning of the shift.  Traced back to a pressure switch for robot 8A-R110-01 end effector.  Pressure was border line so we increased it.
 
Jumped around a pin clamp open input for C107-PE1R for the SWB in underbody station 20.  Had to reteach it between shifts.  This is becoming a regular thing when it gets hot.  We use different switches at pallet to skid and don’t have the issue we have in underbody.  The el’s in underbody would try a different brand.  A Keyence brand switch.
 
Had a high temperature fault on the supply hose for Fender line robot 5A10-R01 at DD34.  Turned off the zone until after production.  Checked and reseated all cable connections between shifts.  Fault has cleared for now.  Temperature setting of the supply hose is 90 degrees F.  It is warmer that now.  
 
AC unit failed on cowl dash TOX controller for robot 9B-250-05.   Controller overheated and faulted.  Open the door to the controller to cool it off.  Later the AC unit started working again.  Pipefitters checked the unit, there are no filters to clog and the coils look clean.  Me and Hoover both ordered new AC units.  
    ",,"HL#10 faulted out on the very first job it ran after 6p.  Swapped the VFD’s.  After shift Erin and Drew checked all the encoder wiring at the VFD.  Many wires were loose.  They stripped all the wires back and relanded them.  Elevator ran numerous jobs in automatic afterward.  
 
Numerous faults on the C05 cross belt on the south side.  Conveyor belt was very loose.   Millwrights adjusted the take up.   Adjusted other belts per their PM’s for the week.

Nights – Snyder
#1 – 6Y-180-02 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 4x for 45min – Fault latched for about 40min after production was over. Repeated issues with step 7 max depth exceeded on program 18. Which then would lead to double fed screws/gun jamming in recovery. Faulting at -19.8mm with a tolerance of -21mm. Changed tolerance to -19.5mm. TM also cleaned up and checked alignment on gun. Gun wasn’t dirty and alignment seemed okay. Did find the jaws were too tight. Adjusted those and off it ran for about 10 jobs with no faults.
 
#7 – 7K-20-R01 – Step 4 min depth not reached/BT3 not measured – 28x for 22min – Gun was retrying on almost all spots. Screw was getting stuck hitting bit when trying to enter nose. Gun #1 was really bad and gun #2 had same issue. We limped through shift on those faults. TM adjusted floating head assembly on both guns between shifts. Ran 3 parts and did not see a re-try. Should help with that issue. Also had issues with escapement in feeder binding up. TM took apart, cleaned and lighy stoned between shifts. Shuffling well manually.
 
6X-20-05 – Head too low – 4x for 12min – Catching up on Rivmon teaching from setter swap.
 
6X-190-06 – Feed fault – 1x for 10min – Tape yanked in nose resulting in tumbled rivet in nose and feed fault. Cleared it all up and ran fine rest of shift.
 
6X-20-04 – Excessive tool force – 3x for 7min – Excessive force filter had been turned on. Turned back off. High force tool. Will convert to black setter if possible.
 
#2 – 7G-10-L03 – Head too low/Abs. position invalid – 8x for 1hr42min – Appears afternoon shift EL had been self medicating a bad setter for quite a while. Tool home offset was constany drifting and failing to home after setting a rivet. Had 11pm TM put a new setter on tool and re-taught Rivmon since it had been taught repeatedly to bad offsets. Setter had 314k on it. Will be tagged and set aside for FRACAS or evaluation. New setter on tool is on its 3rd cycle with the first 2 being premature failures. It ran rest of shift without issue but keep an eye on it.
 
#5 – 7G-70-L01 – Head not back/Step 15 min depth not reached – 23x for 1hr8min – Min depth faults in step 15 on numerous spots. Just barely out of tolerance but too close to open up and risk high screws. Gun was filthy. Had TM clean at 11pm. During cleaning we noticed analog depth sensor was not reading right when the gun was attracted. We adjusted the sensor and did an offset. EL reports it ran rest of shift without any issues.
 
7G-70-R02 – Step 15 min depth not reached – Faulting on a few spots just barely out of tolerance. Went in and checked gun and found analog depth sensor was not reading right as well. Adjusted sensor and did an offset. Ran rest of shift without issues.

#5 – 6Y-80-01 – FDS time delay exceeded – 1x for 12min – Gun would not retract. Had adhesive in head assembly toolmakers cleaned up. Also found the hold down device pressure was low around 2bar. Increased 4 bar. Tool was retracting freely after that.
 
6X-90-04 – Head too high – 4x for 7min – Corner of lift gate opening spot is erratic to say the least. May need to look into touching spot up or seeking deviation for larger tolerances on that one spot if faults persist.

8F125-01 Head too high and insufficient opening faults. Head heights were reading .6 and up. Adjusted velocity in a vain attempt to chase the head heights, FAIL. Installed a black setter, head heights look good but we had to put it in teach 100 even though the calibration looked perfect. Continued to get insufficient opening faults on step 20, chased that for a bit then tried setting the opening full on to 250 on step 19. This moved the fault to step 21. Set the opeing to 250 on step 20 and this cleared up the symptoms. Possibly Tim and Mitch can come up with a solution and put the programming back to where it should be. This is only a minor inconvenience  and created a loss of cycle time of about 3 seconds. Operators were still gone early and the float is over 200.

#1 – 6Y-80-01 – FDS issues – 14x for 29min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Changed to gun to at 11:50pm so we could troubleshoot. Majority of issues were step 15 min depth not reached on numerous programs. We changed a bunch of parameters which made it run much better but still not perfect. Towards end of shift we took tool out to maintenance and noticed the hold down device pressure had been turned all the way up to 6 bar. Turned down to 4 and ran a few jobs. Depths started looking very good. There is no reason to ever increase hold down device pressure to 6 bar. Not sure if it was the parameters or the pressure that made the difference or a combination of both. Seems to be running better now. Monitor. Below are the changes made. If you start getting strip outs (step 15 max time exceeded) go ahead and dial torque back down.
Changes made to 6Y-80-10
Program 1 – Step 15 torque 7nm to 8.5nm. Step 14 RPM from 2500 to 2700. Step 8 pressure from 2.5V to 2.7V (matched other programs that weren’t faulting).
Program 2 – Step 15 torque 7nm to 8.5nm. Step 14 RPM from 2500 to 2700. Step 8 pressure from 2.5V to 2.7V.
Program 6 – Step 15 torque from 8nm to 8.5nm. Step 14 RPM from 2500 to 2700.
Program 5 – Step 15 torque 7nm to 7.5nm.
 
8F-125-01 – Followed up on the setter debacle from days. Seems as if the tool partial was not really understood and was being changed on the wrong spots. Insufficient opening is the Henrob telling you it does not have enough nose-to-die distance to reach the velocity being requested. Checked the change log and it all made sense. Velocity was increased due to high rivets, insufficient opening faults, changed the partial on wrong spot, still faulting, opened partial fully on spots 19-22, no more issues. I showed Mark Smith exacy what was going on and he understands now. We also changed the partials back to what was listed on the 1A4 so cycle time should be better. We can dial them in more while we run as well.
 
#2 – 8Y-10-06 – Step 7 min depth not reached – 10x for 25min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Gun #1 was faulting for min depth on programs 7,8,11 and 12. Adjusted depth tolerances on all these programs. Did not switch back to gun #2 (do not know what’s wrong with gun #2 either) because Josh said they keep breaking bits and jaws. Need to step through both programs and ensure we aren’t putting any side load on the tool when running. By the time I got over there tonight the line was stopped on backed up. We had no units to touch-up. Requires follow-up.
 
7K-40-L02 – Step 7 and Step 4 min depth not reached – 17x for 17min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Step 7 min depth not reached faults on programs 3 and 14. Opened depth tolerances to -24 on these spots. Step 4 min depth on all spots. Depth reading indicates screw getting stuck in baffle and being blocked by bit. Adjusted floating head assembly and it seemed to work. In the process of validating we had some BT2 faults which led to 3 screws making it to the head. Instead of clearing them out I had the TM swap the entire head assembly because the baffle looked pretty chewed up from being hit between the bit and screw so much. Ran 3 parts. All is well.

8F125-01 Head too high, insufficient opening. Found electrician adjusting velocities and asked if he had looked in the tooling, he had not. We found a button in the, ""Loose Die"". Cleared and tightened the die and put the velocities back to original only to fault out again a few parts later. Found the die loose, it seems as though the key in the poke-e-yoke was shifting. Replaced the set screw and fumbled the key around and corrected that issue. Intermittent head too high faults continue to plague us and I can only surmise that we are seeing buttons getting stuck for a cycle and then falling out. I blew out the cell to clear all of the buttons on the floor so we can check it again later to see if that's still happening. We are taping the missing buttons and I have contacted Jared again asking where our rivet die combination change is that he owes us. He says it's curreny with PD and that he will find something out today. 
 
8X100-6 Head too high faults, again found an electrician changing velocities. (Different EL) Explained to him that we do not change velocities until we have determined head height and condition of tooling. Gauged the rivets and found them to be in tolerance.

Setter blew up 20 minutes later error codes were ABS encoder error/ system encoder error and the setter was making that noise I have become accustomed to hearing when they are eating themselves internally.

Nights – Snyder
#1 – 8Y-10-06 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 17x for 42min – Bated faults most the shift. EL had took it upon himself to open up step 15 depth monitoring on program 16. Told him to take it back to where it was and turn up torque instead. Need to monitor and validate these changes. Increasing depth monitoring in step 15 can lead to high screws without suspect tag.
 
#8 – 6Y-80-09 – Hold down device RET not reached/head not back – 5x for 17min – Gun was sticking. Clogged up with adhesive pretty well. Switched to gun #1 to get us going through shift. Between shifts TMs serviced gun. Seems to be working fine now. Ran a few units through.
 
7X-30-R01 – Setter – Tool is showing due for 1MC PM. It is a high force tool. Put the test motor cover on it and ran about 10 jobs. No clearance issues. However tool is a 250072 and we only have one more 250072 setter left in shop. So unless I get more in this will get a blue setter. Need to keep 1 or preferably more than 1 backup black setter for the tools already converted.
 
6Y-80-10 – Vision faults – 6x for 25min – Ever since plastic was taken down we have seen an increase in vision faults on this tool. Not quite sure what root cause is or how to fix it but I’ll look into it tomorrow.
 
6Y-80-10 – Step 15 max time exceeded – Gun was on gun #1 when I got here and has been since Friday. Swapped to gun #2 at 11:30pm. Only saw faults on Friday for max time step 15 on program 2 which I had warned could be an issue due to the torque increase we made for the min depth faults. Reduced torque in step 15 on program 2 and did not see any more faults for that. Gun did have an issue retracting. It was not too dirty. Did find analog depth sensor was out of adjustment which could cause it to behave as if it was sticking. Adjusted sensor and did offset. Ran 3 jobs fine.
 
6Y-180-01 – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Afternoons reported linear bearing rail loose. Had EL swap at end of shift so TMs could work on it. They inspected everything and realigned and tightened slide. Ran 3 jobs. Monitor.
 
7G-70-R02 – Gun #2 had a broken bolt for the hold down foot. We were able to extract broken bolt but the threads on the hold down slide came out with it. All the other bolts were left loose for some reason as well. Tightened it all up and put bolt in stripped hole as a place holder to keep the hold down foot from shifting. Will need to helicoil hole or replace slide in TM shop.
 
7B-110-14 – Toolcheck NOK – Tool failing toolcheck. Reading 0.5 bar. Changed die. No improvement. Changed punch. No improvement. Noticed air was leaking out of head assembly. Did not have new assembly so we installed a new assembly. Started seeing pressure feedback at 2.5 bar during toolcheck. Noticed EL or someone had decreased the minimum pressure in toolcheck to 0.6 bar. I informed Joe Jackey that if it was him he should not do this because it will cause us to build bad parts. Reset toolcheck minimum to 2.5 bar although sister tool runs about 3.5-4 bar. Would like to get new head assembly if possible. Will see if I can find one tonight.

Nights – Snyder
As expected quite a few areas had issues starting up. Also found some unexpected issues.
 
Where did direction come from to remove the connectors on the GBSD for the rivet present cable? Almost the entire shop has connectors removed and have them just laying around on tables and robot controllers. Some are zip tied to hold them straight and most are just flopping around. We are going to see a lot of cable failures on the GBSD side of the cable if we leave them this way. This will not be easy to fix. We need to get them put back to how they were or understand why they were removed in the first place. (See photos)
 
5B-005-01 – Ran parts and verified head heights with gauge. Rivets were good and Rivmon was slightly off so it was taught. This setter is good to go.
 
6Y-150-01 – Rivmon tolerances fat fingered on a few spots. Would not run. Also found not all controllers were completed for the audit.
 
6X-20 – All magazines went into job empty from PMs. Had to abort program and take robots back home in order to get them to dock.
 
6X-20-01 – Fill when not at dock – Once we got this tool to dock it faulted out. Feed tube was routed incorrectly causing it to get smashed in between the mag and dock. Backed robot off and routed the right way. No damage to tube that I saw. Ran a few jobs fine.
 
All Webers have been successfully swapped and are ready to go on gun #1.
 
8Y-10-05 – When we went to swap we could not get tool to pass offset. Analog depth sensor was so far out of adjustment the system constants would not allow it to pass. Adjusted sensor. Good to go.
 
8Y-10-06 – Josh and Mark Smith touched up both LWB and SWB programs on gun #1. Said numerous spots were way off pilot hole locations. Monitor.
 
7K-20-L01 – When swapped found no tool on robot and ATI in locked position. Had to manually teach it through tool change program. Good now.
 
7G-70-L02 – BT2 faults – After swapping to gun #1 feed tube was smashed between toolside and robot side ATI. Dropped gun off and moved tube clear of ATI. Had to swap to back-up tube because primary is no damaged. Once we tried to run back-up tube we found a sliver of tube was blocking screw travel at connection at base of robot. PF had to remove sliver. Good to go. Work order A82549923 written for routing of new primary tube this weekend.
 
Found a few Weber hoppers low or completely empty. Filled what I saw.
 
7G-10-L03 – Would not fun. Kept faulting for pusher not retracted. Found connection for pusher loose. Tightened good to go.
 
7G-10-R03 – Pusher not retracted – Would not run. Proxes lighting up as they should but not seeing it at I/O block. Adjusted sensors. No good. Changed stationary cable at top of feeder to I/O block. No good. Changed feeder. Fixed issue. Took feeder back in rebuild area and saw exact same problem. Swapped hoses, cylinder and prox cables from another known good feeder and problem feeder ran fine. Traced it down to the cables coming from proxes being bad.

6Y-180-04 – Step 7 max depth exceeded faults – Depth reading at +1mm. Indicating no screw in nose. There is no way it should make it past step 4 with no screw in nose. Started digging into it and found step 4 depth monitoring was turned off. Turned it on and set it to where it should be. Started looking at the gun and manually feeding screws. Screw was not making it to nose. Adjusted the FLOAT and verified by feeding about 2 dozen screws that never got hung up. This should take care of the faults. However…not sure if it will take care of the sporadic program 2 step 14 max time exceeded faults.
 
6Y-180-02 – Step 4 max time exceeded faults – Still making loud noises and still faulting. Appears maybe our template isn’t any good (something has moved on the body?). Switched to gun 2 and left it so we would not damage any more parts on gun #1. Need to look into creating a new template with a unit that is curreny being built.

6X80-4 Rivet head heights started to move so Nick Polio requested rivet adjustment from Marty White. Setter started faulting and you could hear it running. The noise is the same one we have heard in the past on high force tools where it sounds like it is eating itself from the inside out. Swapped with another 250102 one time rebuilt blue 60kN setter that had previously been in a high force tool. Within a few cycles you could hear it chewing on itself and we started having problems. First unit head heights were good, second started moving higher, third they were out of tolerance and getting worse. By the 6th unit we were repairing 100% of the rivets and had stopped the line to replace the setter again. I used the last black 250102 high force setter.

8Y-50-03 – Feed faults – Gun randomly started faulting every spot. EL brought it out and called in a GBSD swap but we noticed the light was on the rivet present cable but was not relaying it back to the Henrob. Before swapping GBSD we inspected the cable and found it was loose at the I/O block. Once it was re-seated it ran fine.
 
8Y-10-06 – Step 14 max time exceeded – EL swapped at 10pm. Faulting on nearly all the spots on the back of the UB. This is indicating touch ups may be required. I was tied up in framing respot so we did not hold the units and get the touch ups completed tonight. Still on gun #2. Follow up required on touch-ups.
 
6Y-180-01 – Step 14 max time exceeded – Faulting on program 4 inside cab. Most likely clipping blind clearance holes. Our teardown unit is too far gone to utilize it as a template. Note sent to dimensional team to see if any shifts in bodyside data have occurred.
 
6Y-180-02 – Still on gun #2 from last week. Swapped at end of shift and immediately started hearing the horrible grinding noises inside the cab from the screw clipping blind clearance holes. Attempted to copy and paste gun #2 positional data to gun #1 but were not confident in doing it without units to bump. Please see if this can be done on days/afternoons and trialed. This could help keep us going until template can be made again.
 
6Y-180-04 – Still on gun #2 from last week. Swapped at end of shift and got the step 14 max time exceeded fault on spot #2 again. Compared programs to 180-03 and found pressure in step 13 was far too high. Turned it down to match and ran 2 units. Still needs to be verified further. Everything mechanically on the gun checks out and looks fine.
 
7L-40-R03 – Clinch – It appears clinch was interrupted mid cycle during a part swap. This caused “clinch in cycle” to latch up and not allow the robot to continue onto the next part.

6Y-180-02 – Still running on gun #1 but faulting but now for step 7 min depth not reached. Primarily on programs 4,8,9,10 and 12. It is just barely out of depth tolerance and is clearing itself on retry. We did an offset and only saw a 0.3mm change. Continuing to let it run and will adjust depth tolerance if it becomes a problem.
 
6Y-180-04 – Ran on gun #1 until 11pm. Were getting step 4 max depth exceed faults but it was retrying and recovering on its own most of the time. It progressively got a lite worse. Still also seeing some step 14 max time faults on programs 2 and 3 but nothing too bad. Between shifts we started to dig into it. When we swapped back to gun #1 it failed to do an offset. Adjusted the analog depth sensor properly and still failed. Moved the sensor quite a bit out of adjustment and it passed the offset. After this it went to eject a screw and did see head back even though the analog depth sensor was indicating it was retracted. Put a new analog depth sensor on tool and set it where it needed to be. Once we did this we were able to do numerous offsets and eject screws successfully dozens of times. This could have been the cause for all the faults. We ran 5 jobs without issue. Continue to monitor.

Feedback from Nordson says that one of the thermocouples is shorting or showing completely open and their software has a baked in setting that generates the protection fault as a fail safe.

9A30-2W Started my day at HFE on a breakdown that had been going on for an hour, 9A30-2W's nut sensing prox and cover plate were damaged and not functioning. Not sure what had been going on or the direction they were going but I was able to find a new assembly which consists of the punch housing, nut sensing prox, cover plate and screws in the TM shop.(There were 9 of them) after installation the electricians wired it to the plug end and verified the light came on with a nut present. All seemed well. Fired up the tool and it would not cycle, after some CSI it was determined that the prox was not correcy wired. Corrected that and tried again. We could not get the tool to load a nut so we hand loaded one and it cycled, went to the next position and did not load a nut so we tried manually raising the nut load arm and found it does not fit in the opening when the hydro form is in place. Started over, had to hand load another nut, and another. Then it started running on it's own. During this time we were also combing through the logic looking for the reason why and never really determined why it would not cycle on its own or why it started running.

Ended up finding that not only were the slugs there but the nut was not even really being pressed into the part. TMs changed the die and cleared slugs from exit tube. This did not fix it. Ended up finding the stop block on the moveable side broken in half. Searched stores and found zero. Searched shop and found zero. Had to have Allen Niemann make one from scratch. Once he got it made we installed it. It took us a while to get cell back going due to it being out of sequence. Once everything was back in order we began running parts. Inspector and operator checked all parts rest of shift and did not see any more slugs and all nuts passed torque check. Keep an eye out for slugs and failing nuts as I am not sure the stop block fixed the issue.
 
7B-110-14 – Clinch controller fault force<min force – 3x for 36min – Jackey’d. Tool faulted. Tool was taught while it wasn’t fully open causing a slight crash. Had to replace punch. Good now.

8C-10-01 – Spac nut 4PX PP not on – 4x for 34min – Nuts getting stuck in chuting. TMs called. They cleared the jam and emptied chuting and cleaned up and checked jaws. Seemed to have fixed issue. If it continues Chip and Todd suggested we replace jaws. Monitor.

6Y-180-02 – Max time exceeded – 2x for 38min – Smoked a bit on gun #2. They went to swap to gun #1 which took a minute and once they swapped to gun #1 found that the jaws and bit were busted on that one as well. In middle of program with 2 bad guns we had to stop and fix the gun #1 to get back running. TM did a full health assessment and repair on both guns between shifts. Back on gun #2.

8A-100-FX2 – Failed Destaco clamp – 1x for 2hr – TMs replaced clamp and then it took a while to get everything back in sequence for the cell to take off running again. Once we cleared the parts and shift registers it ran fine.
 
7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 5x for 56min – Seemed like the tool got out of sequence. It was calling for stud not trapped but when reset it kept the pusher back and sent a stud resulting in it shooting straight out of feeder to the ground. Could not get it to feed and trap one in auto properly. To get it back going we had to go in and manually move the pusher and manually feed a stud out and trap it. Once we did that it took off just fine and ran. Henrob has requested we install the Tutometer on the RH side as well so they can monitor the stud feeding like LH side.
 
9A-40-02 – Jammed up – 4x for 33min – Not sure what original fault was but when I got there the EL had sent out about 7 or 8 screws to the head resulting in it being badly jammed up. Once we purged the tool of all the screws and got it back going it had no more issues.
 
7A-20-13 – Tool probe A position – 6x for 28min – Rivets stuck transitioning from dock to mag not allowing the magazine fill probe to reach is returned position. Cleared issue by tapping on magazine to free up rivets. Once we did this the probe cycled as expected and ran.

Webers not on gun #2 – 7K-30-R05 and 6Y-80-10 – Both will be worked on over weekend and put back on gun #2.
 
6Y-80-10 – 6x for 33min – Gun sticking again. I am thinking analog depth sensor is the issue. Didn’t get a chance to work on it tonight but will get to it this weekend.
 
7K-40-L02 – 8x for 10min – Step 15 max time exceeded fault. When I got called over gun was at maintenance and stuck in the retract position. It would not return. Haven’t really seen this happen before. Ended up just putting it back in auto and it returned home and continued on.
 
6X-20-17 – Head too low – 3x for 11min – One unit came through and Rivmon didn’t like it. Was just barely out of tolerance. Once we got through that unit had no more problems.
 
7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 4x for 1hr29min – Had stud not trapped faults and double rivet faults. Went in to check punch and found something wrong with setter. Could move the punch all around in an elliptical shape. Replaced setter. Had some Rivmon issues after new setter but we smoothed those out. Need to try and get a good count on how many setters we have burnt through on these 2 tools and go to Henrob with it. Email sent to VO squad informing of the issues we continue to have.
 
7G-20-R01 – Escapement retry fault – 2x for 1hr22min – Nuts getting stuck in escapement. Toolmakers had to disassemble escapement and clean up the edges on the transition piece from the escapement to nut chuting.
 
7G-20-L01 – Valve output failure – 1hr – Nuts not leaving escapement. TMs came and cleaned up escapement. No better. EL (very unfamiliar with area) pointed to valve being bad. Had PF come over and check that. It was working as expected. Nut would escape and just hover in the chute. Thought maybe there were nuts backed up obstructing air flow. Cleared chuting and blew pressurized air through it. Nothing was stuck. Removed the transition piece from escapement to chute. Slighy better but still not fixed. Finally we tried to re-terminate the end of chuting going into the escapement this fixed the issue. Appears it was slighy crushed not allowing the nut to travel through it and not allowing air to properly push the nut through.
 
9A-10-01 – Head too low – 7x for 53min – Faulting repeatedly on spots 2 and 8. Just barely out of tolerance. Adjusted nominal to accept these fluctuations.

#1 – 7K-30-R05 – FDS – 1x for 22min – Fault happened after production was done. Did gun swap to gun #2 to fix it. Gun has been binding for a couple days. We removed the dust cover and cleaned and lubricated the cylinder behind it. Took care of issue immediately.
 
#2 – 8Y-40-03 – Feed fault – 3x for 20min – Swapped GBSD and that fixed issue.
 
7A-20-13 – Rivet not escaped – 1x for 20min – TM took mag apart and cleaned it online. When the EL sent it back in we got rivet not escaped due to mag being empty. In order to auto dock we had to abort the program and take it home. Once it filled it ran fine as far as that goes.
 
7A-20-13 – Rivet time delay exceeded – Joe Jackey called me over and told me he kept getting time delay faults. The Henrob was not faulted but the robot was. Seems the robot is not getting “head back” soon enough. I sat and watched it run for a good 40min and did not see it happen. Told Joe next time it faults to let it sit so we can find out what may be causing the issue. Monitor.",,,,,"Observed at lot of fore and aft movement on lift table #29 in the mezz around AA38.

8Y-10-06 – Spindle stroke front end position reached – 8x for 20min – Found spindle sensor completely loose. Took a few tries to get it adjusted just right. Once we got it set there didn’t seem to be any more issues.
 
6X-20-01 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 16min – EL reset fault a few times trying to get it to run. Trained him on the fact that you can’t fault reset this fault. It requires manual intervention. At this point there were about 4 rivets jammed in feedstick. TMs came and cleared them out and we ran after that.
 
9B-250-06 – Stud weld fault (low penetration) – 15x for 37min – Faulting for low penetration and studs were snapping off. Parts seemed quite a bit oily. Afternoons changed collet and boot. Looking at the gun the inner and outer flash shield along with the ceramic ring showed heavy signs of wear and were filthy. The inner flash ring being this dirty could impede the argon shielding gas from making it to the work surface during the weld. Also it was so burnt up it was no longer a flat round surface which would also let gas escape during welding. In order to get them back going we swapped over to gun #2 and ran that for a few hours. Gun #2 had one low penetration fault with 1 bad stud but that’s it. At 2:30 break we went in and installed new inner/outer flash shields and ceramic ring. Swapped back to gun #1 and ran remainder of shift. Had 1 low penetration fault which passed toque inspection. Seems to be running much better. Monitor.

8X-090-01: Head too low, Broken Die.  Need to touch up the rivets around the cowl top on LWB and SWB. Not able to complete between shifts, units not set up and we were backed into Framer.
 
8Y10-6 Needs program touch up on SWB, not able to complete between shifts, backed into Framer. 
 
7G10R-3 stud not trapped x2. Cleared and ran
 
8Y40-4 GBSD swapped between shifts then again at start up. Eric Rossignol needs to be reminded daily that he is not to clear faults from the Henrob controller. We found a unit with a punch dent and no rivet that did not come in suspect. He seemed confused when I explained this to him and stated, ""That's a new one on me"". I used my best stern voice without losing my mind and explained to him that we have had this conversation in the past and that the next conversation will happen in labor relations.

 Nights – Snyder
8Y-10-06 – On gun #1 again when I got here. Switched over to gun #2 at lunch and touched up the SWB. Ran it rest of shift with no issues. Monitor.
 
6X-60-04 – Step 7 min depth not reached – 1x for 8min – Had a unit make it from underbody that was not sitting down on the pins of the pallet. Bodyside was completely off location causing the flow drill faults. Had to scrap unit. Repair team is going to use unit to cut some templates for nuts.
 
5C-200-01 – Worked on touching up squeeze out concerns brought up by paint on both LWB and SWB rear doors. On the top of window opening flange we were dumping adhesive in a spot with no hem flange. We moved the bead up and away from that spot which cleared up the squeeze out. Found random drops of adhesive all along the door. Went in and found the rollers were absolutely covered in adhesive. I am not sure how much accumulates during a shift but I would venture to guess not as much as we saw tonight. Had TM come clean all rollers which took care of issue. Also had a talk with all TMs and ensured they were cleaning every single hem roller between shifts.
 
Bodyside Hem Squeeze Out – Did not work on this tonight. Please try to line up work between shifts or at lunch to correct the concern noted in paints email.
 
6X-180-03 – Changed setter for 1MC PM. First rotation that will need to be checked is 9761.
 
6X-180-04 – Changed setter for 1MC PM. First rotation that will need to be checked in 9761.
 
8F-120-03 – Changed Setter for 1MC PM. Inspector will need to pull out one of first rear ladders to check.
 
8X-90-05 – Setter is almost due. Not reporting in FIS. Please try to swap between shifts. If not I’ll do it tonight.
 
8X-90-01 – Investigated why we keep breaking dies. Think we found root cause. Both LWB and SWB programs were so far off normal to metal it wasn’t even funny. If I remember correcy it was reported they were touched up before. Is this true? Touched up both programs. Should be good now.

Nights – Snyder
8Y-10-06 – Went through programs. Found nothing wrong. Had TMs go through gun. Didn’t find anything. Went through the Weber schedules in nauseating detail comparing them from gun #1 to gun #2. Found only 2 discrepancies on the trouble spots. On program 23 we changed the step 13 voltage from 1 to 2.5 to match its sister program on gun #1. We also changed program 16 step 14 voltage from 1 to 1.8 to match its sister program.  The numbering convention of the programs since Barnett modified them is quick confusing and all over the place. Makes it hard to track which faults are tied to what spot, model and gun. Maybe we can discuss with him and come up with something better and update the paperwork with it. For now it is on gun #2. If it doesn’t run I plan to suffer with that tool Monday night and get it figured out. Swapping during afternoons isn’t helping because we are trying to piece a puzzle together on nights without actually seeing the faults.
 
7L-40-L01 – Time delay exceeded – 14x for 20min – There was some confusion because tool wouldn’t fire a rivet and would just sit there without a fault on Henrob but robot would time out. There was no lighted cable installed on the GBSD so seeing feed issues wasn’t as easy. Found the tool was actually experiencing feed faults but EL had increased the “sprocket pull before fault” count from 3 to 9. This essentially will keep trying to feed until the robot times out which then does not throw a fault. Changed GBSD and installed a cable with a light. Also reduced pulls back to 3. No more issues.
 
6X-20-02 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 10min – Had our 1 time nighy occurrence of rivet not trapped. Cleared it for multiple rivets. Cleared rivets and then it ran.
 
6X-20-02 – Head too low – 5x for 8min – Adjusted Rivmon nominal end distance.
 
6Y-180-01 – Max depth gradient exceeded – 3x for 7min – Pretty much a nuisance fault. Increased depth gradient on step 5 from 115 to 120mm/s.
 
5A-20-01 – Feed faults – 2x for 1hr – Original issue was a bent punch. Punch and nose were replaced. Then still had feed faults. Got there after first GBSD swap. Still faulted. They had begun the process of a setter swap. Shut that down. Chewed up tape was in sprocket so we fed fresh tape and tried again. Still feed faulting. Put another GBSD on and it ran. The first GBSD passed 200 rivets on test stand without issue. Not sure what was wrong.
 
9A-20-01 – Nut feeder escapement – 2x for 30min – TM came and cleaned and cleared escapement. In the process of troubleshooting before TMs arrived EL had valved the press and caused 2 nuts to be wedged in the feed arm. Took some finesse to get the nuts out. Once we did that and got it back in sequence it took off.

We believe one of the dunnage photo eyes one the end effector was intermittent.  Replaced both photo eyes, 104-5PXS and 104-6PXS.  Took a couple of tries to get them adjusted.  We think we got it.  Also Jelley touch up the approach point to drop off the short moon roof over fixture 2.  Roof rubbed the top of the roof separation stanchion on the back left side of the roof when dropping into the rack.          ",,,All Webers on gun #2.,,,"Like to recognize Clinton Anderson and Gary Austion for their hard work preparing our satellite stores for the audit.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Parts:,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Audited START cards on Clinton Anderson and Gary Austin,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

#2 – 8Y-10-06 – Step 14 max time/Step 15 max time/mind depth – 14x for 20min – Still getting numerous process faults on gun #2 towards back end of cab. We have cross referenced all programs and found no differences. We have touched up programs and have went through gun mechanically. Dave said Tom Ash from Weber is here this week. Maybe he can spend some quality time over there. You can head the screws grinding on the clearance holes but EL stated the program is good. I did not have time between shifts to complete any work on it tonight.
 
#4 – 8Y-90-04 – Head too low – 5x for 18min – Spot 22 and spot 33 end distance trending towards top of graph. Brought back down to nominal. Did not see any abnormal spikes in end distance.
 
#5 – 6X-20-02 – Rivet not trapped – 2x for 18min – TMs cleared rivets to keep it running. During lunch we went in and installed a new dynamic t-tube. Ran rest of shift without faults but that wasn’t very many units. Monitor.
 
#6 – 6Y-80-10 – BT3 not measured – 4x for 17min – Hopper was over filled and jammed the step up not allowing screws to feed. Cleared the way for screws to feed. Good now.
 
#9 – 6X-20-14 – Head too low – 7x for 15min – Faulting on quite a few spots barely out of tolerance. Sent a couple units suspect for inspector to verify. Once he said the rivets were good we put tool into teach 100 and did not have any more issues.
 
7K-40-02 – Step 15 max time exceeded – Faulting on both spot 2 and 3. EL changed gun after first 3 faults. They said heads were still being stripped on screws. Did not have time between shifts to really work on tool. Still on gun #1.
 
7K-40-R01 – Head too low – 7x for 10min – End distance trending high. Inspector verified rivets and then we taught problem joints.
 
6Y-80-09 – Hold down device not ret – Having issues with gun sticking. Adhesive built up in head. TMs cleaned head assembly. Tool continued to run.
 
6Y-180-01 – Step 5 max depth gradient exceeded – Depth gradient still gradually increasing on program 24. Bumped it up a lite more to get rid of faults. Screw may be getting hung up and not dropping to the nose in time and the tool fixes itself on retry.
 
#1 – 7G-10-L03 – Stud not escaped – 2x for 1hr37min – Henrob installed flow monitor in cube between shifts and did not stay to validate start up. Right at 6:02 we began having issues feeding the studs to the gun. After extensive trouble shooting looking at valves and so on we ended up ripping the flow monitor out because it appeared it was bleeding out all our feed air pressure. Once we pulled it out we still had a few issues feeding studs. Found the air pressure wasn’t set quite right. Took us some time to dial it in just right without getting stud not trapped faults. I had VO call Henrob and wake up their tech to send him in to support his tool last night. He stayed until about midnight.
 
#2 – 7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 9x for 1hr7min – Still getting faults trying to trap studs. We did not change any components tonight but just kept clearing the stud and letting it run. Henrob tech had no advice other than we need to take out the magnetic punch. Which makes no sense because the stud is making it to the nose just not getting trapped. They are probably going to hold on to this excuse AGAIN just like they have been so may need to change the punch during the day. I would say to continue running the modified chamfer style though.
 
#3 – 7G-70-R01 – Max time exceeded – 3x for 30min – Had a couple max time faults. One occurrence saw some extended downtime due to EL working with us on the stud guns.
 
#6 – 7G-70-L03 – Stud stuck in tube – 3x for 22min – Faults were a result of us having to change air pressure after Henrob flow monitor install.
 
7G-50-01 – Broke baffle – Baffle that drops screw into head was broken. Replaced head.
 
7B-30-01 – Robot touch up RH b-pillar – Inspector notified me the buttons had strange marks on them. Watched tool run and noticed the robot was not backing away from die enough after rivet and was dragging the button and part across the die as it moved to next spot. Metal shavings all over the floor indicate this has been going on since install of the cell most likely. Rivets are good but we needed to get it fixed to avoid breaking a die. Richard Mattingly gave it a valiant effort but he was not comfortable and made quite a few mistakes along the way. The program is still dragging on the first 2 spots of the RH b pillar. Please see if we can get Risinger or someone with a stronger robot background to step this program through and fix the issue.

 8Y10-6 down shory after I got here, gun 1 would not run and gun 2 was faulting on program 17 step 15 max time exceeded. Made the call to touch up that one point. That took some time due to fumbling but we pulled it together and got it done. While putting the line back in auto a warning displayed on the HMI indicated robot 8Y10-6 was not in auto, sent up a flare for help and continued investigating. Finally it was determined by Tom Ash from Weber that the safety relay in the Weber controller had failed. We pulled one from the test stand in the TM shop, installed it and started running. Ran most of the day fault free but burned up a bit toward the end of the shift. Gun 1 has been gone over and had the head assembly replaced and the bearings aligned but has not been tested in auto. Gun 2 was also gone over at the end of shift

#1 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 17x for 38min – Ran on gun #1 all night. Appears gun #1 doesn’t even get us by comfortably. Also appears Tom Ash has no suggestions on how to resolve the issue we have been having nearly a year now. We are getting pretty good at repairing flow drills though!
 
#2 – 6X-20-03 – Double rivet – 1x for 29min – Just as I was getting here Dave said the setter failed on this tool. He said home offset was jumping and faulting on every spot. He began the process of putting the BLACK setter we had taken out the other day back in. The process was prolonged by TMs forgetting a spacer on the setter install. I set the cycle count on the setter to reflect how many cycles it was at when we took it off earlier in the week. Once it was homed and calibrated it took off and ran rest of shift.
 
#6 – 6Y-180-01 – Step 15 max time exceeded – 12x for 22min – Joints stripping out. A lot of faults on program 17. ELs are set to touch up the cowl top/HFE joints between shifts. Monitor at start up.
 
#8 – 6Y-80-09 – FDS process faults – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Switched to gun #2 and found analog depth sensor was out of adjustment. Adjusted sensor and tool ran fine for a while. Had a few different faults on the tool. Made a few parameter adjustments that seemed to help. Program 13 step 9 depth changed from -19mm to -19.5mm. Program 14 step 15 torque changed from 7nm to 7.5nm. Program 3 step 9 depth changed from -19mm to -19.5mm. Also noted gun was sticking again. TMs replace head assembly and bit between shifts.
 
#9 – 6X-20-03 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 14min – One time occurrence. TMs came and cleared rivets. Ran rest of shift without incident.
 
#10 – 6X-20-02 – Head too high – 6x for 13min – Adjusted end distance nominal on numerous spots once we got word from inspector joints were good.
 
8Y-80-02 – Feed fault – 4x for 25min – Appareny EL limped tool through shift. TMs replace GBSD and nose between shifts. Noted there was an insane amount of grease flowing out of the filter and down the setter. Appears this was one of our 4MC rebuilds from Henrob. Photos sent to Henrob. They said “its normal.” They lie. See photos. Keep an eye.
 
8Y-40-05 – Double rivet- 1x for 10min – A ejected FDS was sitting on UB. Rivet gun riveted on it burying it into the pan and putting a slight hole in unit. Rotation is 1991. Pictures and information have been sent to days so they can implement a repair. I think a lite metal work and a coupon welded to the unit should work out okay. Or if they can fill the split.
 
7K-40-L02 – Step 14 max time/Step 4 min depth – 5x for 9min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. 2 faults were from gun #1. Put back on gun #2 at about 11pm. Ran really well for first hour. Then had a few faults. Each time the screw was stripped out with chewed up threads.
 
6X-20-17 – Head too low – 5x for 9min – Adjusted end distance nominal once joint was inspected and confirmed good.
 
6X-190-03 – Head too low – 3x for 8min – Adjusted end distance nominal on numerous spots.
 
6Y-150-02 – Head too low – 3x for 8min – Adjusted end distance nominal on numerous spots. Joints were good according to inspector.
 
6Y-110-02 – FDS process faults – 4x for 5min – Made the following parameter adjustments and did not have another fault rest of shift. Program 19 step 5 depth gradient changed from 100mm/s to 110mm/s. Program 21 step 15 torque changed from 8nm to 8.5nm. Program 22 step 5 and 6 depth gradient changed from 100mm/s to 110mm/s. Program 20 step 15 torque changed from 8nm to 8.5nm.
 
7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 7x for 1hr12min – And the saga continues. Only changes made tonight were removing the magnetic punch (I don’t know what time it was changed. Wasn’t on nights) and running with regular punch. Still had some faults. Henrob engineering from the UK are paddling across the ocean as I type this. We also cleaned both hopper because Henrob says they are too dirty to run. Went to change the main blow valve on LH side but stores is on strike I guess...
 
8E-210-01 – Head too low – 18x for 34min – Definitely have some odd material things going on. Will fault out on same part in 250. Adjusted end distance nominal to accommodate fluctuations.
 
8E-250-01 – Head too low – 4x for 16min – See above.
 
7B-30-01 – Still sticking on first 2 spots on second pass of RH B-pillar. I reduced velocity from 300 to 265mm/s. Rivets are reading in the +0.20-+0.24mm range. I also put a 0.1s squeeze on those two spots (16&17) to maybe help close a gap or form the joint or something. Seemed to have eliminated issue on spot 2 (17) but first spot (16) is still sticking here and there. Keep an eye on the rivets to make sure they don’t go out of spec.

8Y10-6 Multiple faults all day.  Started on gun 1 faulting every other job, swapped to gun 2 and started faulting every job. Swapped back to gun 1 and attempted to touch it up at lunch. Came out of lunch and ran several jobs before we started faulting multiple times on every job, Toolmakers went in and aligned the gun and replaced the bit. Ran a couple more jobs and things got worse, put it in bypass. Plan is to stop jobs at the entrance to Respot when Mainline hits 210 and touch up programs on gun 1 which seems to be the more reliable of the two guns. Programs touched up both guns.

6X180-5 Head too low faults.  Setter was put in teach 100 4 times today and continued to fault. Setting up to swap setter between shifts. Swapped and verified with no faults. 
 
6Y150-4 Head too high fault due to button sticking in die, attempted to replace it but could not get it out in a timely manner so it was cleaned out and we ran the rest of the day. Went back at the end of the shift and replaced it and found the poke-yoke rotated, turned it back to align the hole with the hole in the c frame and tightened it down. Needs follow up to epoxy the poke yoke in properly

#2 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS fun – 55x for 1hr38min – I spent literally every minute of the production shift standing at this tool tonight. When I got here we were on gun #1 and running very poorly (20+ faults). Inspectors informed me it was shipping units with bad screws without them being suspect. I began making changes to parameters on multiple programs to make it run. Also reduced some parameters that were opened causing the bad screws without suspect tag. This seemed to help for a lite while but it began running very poorly again (another 20 faults). We noticed the SWB programs were at a very odd angle (15+ degrees off) on the back of the cab. We touched that up to make the gun perpendicular to the metal. This took care of some faults but not all of them. With 10-05 running pretty well we went ahead and completely copied the Weber schedules running in 10-05 and installed them onto 10-06 ad 12am. We had to do some modifying of the spot callouts in the robot to do this but it was not too bad of a task. Once it started up we thought this may have been the answer we were looking for. We quickly found out it wasn’t because we began seeing the same issues. We modified these parameters to try to make it run better with lite to no success (11 faults). As of now most all of our faults are either max time or min depth step 15 (a lot on program 2). I am at a loss on what to do. Only other thing I can think of is we are having some sort of signal cable issue causing us to get erratic readings on numerous programs. But the readings seem to match the physical condition of the joint so this is unlikely. I have asked if Dave Joiner is available today to come help us figure this out. Tom Ash was here this week watching us bleed and did nothing and then just up and left without offering any help. I will bring this up to VO. Like I said…I am out of ideas. If anyone has fairy dust they would like to pour onto the tool please feel free.
 
#4 – 6Y-180-02 – Max time exceeded – 4x for 32min – Received texts from Paul Glardon that we broke a bit on gun #2. He swapped to gun #1 but saw toolmaker shory after. Swapped back to gun #2 and had them replace bit. Ran rest of shift.
 
#5 – 6X-100-04 – Head too low – 9x for 26min – Received texts from inspector that he was getting a bunch of suspect units off this tool and the rivets were good. Texted line EL and had him adjust nominal end distance. I believe this took care of these faults.
 
#7 – 6Y-110-02 – FDS – 13x for 19min – Looks like this one has come back. Never got a chance to work on it. Will follow up tomorrow if I am not handcuffed to 10-06.
 
#9 – 6X-20-03 – Double rivet – 1x for 16min – Right as I was getting here Dave said there was possibly another setter going into 20-03. They noticed it was a model we don’t run many units of. Rivmon just needed adjusted. Once they did that it ran fine. Crisis averted.
 
8X-40-04 – Head too low – 4x for 12min – Hopped over there real quick and adjusted end distance nominal on spot 3 since it was the only spot faulting.
 
8Y-20-05 – Head too high – 1x for 10min – Mark Smith informed me setter was growling when he came in tonight. Told him we would keep an eye on it. Through the night I could hear it getting louder and louder while I was standing at station 10. Eventually we began getting faults on numerous spots. End distance was trending low and peak force was trending high. This is a solid indication the setter was about to lay its own soul to rest. I checked the rivets and adjusted Rivmon to keep the tool limping along for the last hour and a half of production. Towards the end it got even worse and was back faulting again. Once we were done running toolmakers installed a new/rebuilt 250032 setter on the tool. The one running only had 290k cycles at 56kn and was a 1 time rebuild from us. First rotation for new setter is 2475.
 
On a positive note the stud guns in 7G didn’t even make it to the top 10 tonight. So we have that going for us….for today.","#1 and #3 main.  We believe electricians caused this fault by changing the rack part count in the robot controller.

6X20-3 Nose switch faults, swapped feedstick with wrong one. Installed correct one to make it run. Toolmakers installed a 5mm feedstick instead of a 5+mm feedstick. Had them move the 5mm feedsticks over to the blue tools to help prevent reoccurrence. We may want to eliminate the 5mm sticks and just go with 5+ since they can be ran in place of a 5mm.

#2 – 6X-20-03 – Nose switch fault – 4x for 33min – First few times EL called and waited on TM to come remove feedstick and check pusher. I showed them how to recover from this on their own and keep the line moving without waiting on anyone. I suspect the punch is hanging up in the nose because the pusher moves freely. So either the punch is burred or the nose is twisted/bad. Will get it this weekend.
 
#7 – 6X-100-04 – Head too low – 7x for 14min – Had a sudden burst of faults just like last night. Units were good so Rivmon was adjusted. Seems end distance keeps climbing. May need a setter swap soon. Tool has been checked off as a good candidate for a black setter so when we do swap it we will be installing one of those.
 
#8 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 6x for 14min – This one ran very well tonight. Thanks to Daves magic parameter combination. I had inspectors actively monitoring units throughout the night checking for high screws due to some parameters being opened up to let it run. They said they only saw a couple high screws all night.
 
6X-40-06 – Head too high – 5x for 8min – Bad k-brace parts causing bad rivets and Rivmon faults. Pulled parts off-line and notified Epps.
 
9B-250-06 – Stud weld faults – Maintenance counter for feed tube was in the red causing faults every stud. Reset counter.
 
7G – Stud guns did not make an appearance in top 10 again.

 -Due to frequency of “143 Drive Flt Comms” faults on Henrob gun changers, we added a program call in SetGun1 to look for a value of 143 in GI(49).  If it is true, call new program Drive_Rst.  Drive_Rst will pulse DO(10095) and DO(10099) to attempt to reset this fault automatically. After three attempts, it will continue on and fault as it did before these changes were made to the program.

 ","6X-100-04 - Did not have manpower or time to swap setter this weekend. If it keeps acting up and rivmon keeps going crazy swap to a BLACK setter. But make sure to step through minor maintenance program. My notes indicated we touched up the position but need to verify with the actual setter and not just the template.
PMs - We did not get many PMs done with weekend due to little manpower and time. The remainder are in the folder in the shop. Please assign someone to them between shifts so we don’t get behind.
8Y-10-06 - Make sure inspectors are actively monitoring units for high screws. Parameters are still kind of open on some spots.
6X-20-03 - If nose switch faults appear replace punch first. We have already done the feedstick and nose. Did not have time or people to work on this weekend.
 
Two times in the past 2 weeks we have had a die break on a tool. When I went to check it out and remove the old die we found the poke-yoke sleeve was completely missing from the c-frame. The sleeve should be epoxied into the c-frame which would take a lot of effort to remove. The only reason I can think some have been removed is during a breakdown where the TMs had difficulties removing a broke die they took it to the shop and punched out the sleeve. Or I have witnessed some TMs pulling dies from tools by gripping it with channel locks and twisting/pulling it. I have spoken to all night-shift guys and informed them not to twist the die out and to check for a poke-yoke whenever they are called to replace a die.
 
Not having the sleeve in there leaves the die loose increases the chances of it falling out or breaking. I also do not want to be like Kansas City and have a 40k truck “issue” because we installed the wrong die due to a poke-yoke not being present. If you are ever involved in a breakdown where a die has been broken or removed please ensure the TMs double check that a sleeve is present.",,,"Gave Mark Howard Dave Fouts coins for their diligent efforts for cleaning up and repairing sealer systems Saturday night  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Parts:,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,8,17,18,3,20,19,14,2,3,12,12,5,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nights – Snyder
#1 – 6X-160-01 – Head too high – 7x for 44min – Joints were inspected and deemed good. Adjusted end distance nominal.
 
#3 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 14x for 34min – Touched up first two spots on SWB. Seemed to have helped quite a bit. Only 2 faults after this.
 
#9 – 7L-40-R03 – Min force out of force envelope – 7x for 17min – Weird fault I have not seen before. Appears some tolerances were fat fingered. Adjusted back to where they should be and had no more issues.
 
7L-30-L02 – Force < min force – 4x for 8min – Adjusted minimum force tolerance on program 21.
 
6Y-80-09 – FDS faults – 6x for 25min – Had some step 2 max time faults. This is an indication the signal cable may be going bad. EL also said they had issues ejecting screw and had also screwed on top of an existing screw. Swapped to gun #2 to get through shift. Between shifts the gun was PM’d and bit was replaced.
 
#4 – 8F-150-05 (gun #1) – Head too high – 4x for 58min – Cant speak for response time but I did check out the graphs and we are seeing some pretty drastic spikes here and there. Was not something we could adjust our way out of. Will keep an eye on it and see whats going on.
 
#7 – 7G-70-R01 – FDS faults – 4x for 48min – Faulting for step 7 max depth exceeded on program 9. Adjusted depth settings. Also getting head not back faults on the Weber. This seems like an issue with the robot timing out before the Weber has finished its screw sequence. All it takes is a fault reset. But we had an EL from out of area up there and he had some difficulty with the recovery. He has been trained now.
 
#9 – 7G-10-R03 – Cube A run time – 2x for 33min – Feeder ran out of studs and needed team leader to replenish.
 
#10 – 7G-70-R01 – FDS time delay exceeded – 4x for 30min – See #7 above.

When the elevator was no longer in position, the pallet transferring in stopped, with steel stanchion guide for the Bart Simpson protruding thru frame work of the pallet.  Removed stanchion and the Bart Simpson and forced the pallet on to the table.  We attempted to run elevator without the elevator locks receiver on the entrance side, but the elevator drifted too much when the units transferred on.   Bottom of the pallet rubbed on the framework of the single roller stand.  Increased the encoder counts in the PLC for the raised position of the elevator and opened up the in position window.

#1 – 7X-10-L04 (Gun #2) – Feed fault – 10x for 30min (4D) – ELs began getting feed faults. Went in and found a new spool they had installed was missing rivets in the tape (known incoming quality issue with Henrob). ELs changed spool and immediately got feed faults again. Went in to investigate and found a crushed rivet in the nose. Appears they yanked the tape too hard when changing the spool. They spent some time trying to extract the rivet fragment with no success. Called TMs to change GBSD and nose. Once we pulled the GBSD we noticed the punch face was chipped (most likely from crushing rivet). So we changed the punch as well. Went to start back up and got feed faults. Rivet was not making the nose switch. Tape was difficult to pull through. Tried opening up nose switch housing to release some tension with no success. Checked the switch/cable function with a allen wrench and it worked fine. But it did appear switch was stuck in a ""mid"" position. Installed another GBSD and nose and then we were able to run.
#6 – 8Y-10-05 – Step 5 max time exceeded – 2x for 15min – Gun failed to run and would not run a single screw after that. Swapped to gun #2 to finish shift. Between shifts swapped back to investigate. Ran a friction test and that failed immediately for too much torque and no rotation. Suspected bad transducer since that wouldn’t spin. Pulled old transducer and noted that it spun freely and so did the bit. Traces it back to the drive belt. Gun #2 has been pulled from the cell and taken back to toolmaker shop for belt replacement/inspection. WE CURRENY ONLY HAVE ONE GUN IN CELL. NO BACKUP AVAILABLE. There are a few guns on the bench in the shop but I was unsure of the state they are in so I did not put one of them in the cell. We will need to follow up on those.

#1 – 8Y-10-05 – Step 14 max time/Step 15 max time – 8x for 25min – Was on gun #2 when I got here. Switched to gun #1 at lunch to get it going. Had quite a few strip outs. Swapped back to gun #2 for remainder of shift. Swapped back at end of shift. EL touched up programs and TMs replaced worn out bit. Ran 10 more jobs without issue. Still on gun #1. Monitor.
 
#3 – 8X-90-06 – Feed fault – 5x for 19min – EL kept resetting fault to keep tool limping along. Noticed rivet present cable was flickering. Could not find cable with LED and could only purchase cables that needed assembly. Installed a regular yellow 5 pin Turck to get us going. Purchased 5 cable kits from stores and have Clinton Anderson making them up right now.
 
#4 – 8Y-110-05 – Feed fault – 1x for 17min – Robot brought out to gate and we could not get it to go back in. Light screen would not reset. Had to toggle off the minor maintenance request bit from robot to get tool to go back in and run.
 
#6 – 7L-40-L01 – Head too high – 2x for 14min – Adjusted nominal end distance on a few spots. Inspector verified rivets were good. 
 
#8 – 6Y-180-01 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 2x for 11min – Found some VERY odd depth tolerances set up on a few programs. Adjusted those to something more standard and that fixed the faults.
 
6Y-100-05 – Suspect buttons – Inspector noted on a unit that the buttons appeared to be near falling off. We contained that one unit and went and checked the tool. Only thing I could find was a bunch of adhesive and aluminum shavings hardened up in the die. Cleaned the die and had inspector doing more frequent checks throughout the shift and did not find anymore. Keep an eye on it.
 
8Y-90-01 – Adjusted end distance nominal on spots 2 and 5.
 
8F-150-05 Gun #2 – Head too high – 11x for 46min – Sporadically getting Rivmon faults. Rivets all checked good. The spikes in the end distance were quite drastic so we couldn’t adjust our way out of it. Tried changing velocities a few times with no success. Ended up setting all spots back to 285mm/s like they were upon installation and it got somewhat better. Had to open up the low end tolerance to 0.50mm on a couple spots. I don’t think it’s the setter. Home offset is solid and it comes and goes. No trend. Keep an eye on it.
 
8F-130-03 – Head too low/nose switch fault – 2x for 40min – Bunch broken and stuck in nose. Replaced punch, nose and GBSD. No more issues.

8Y-10-03 – Velocity change – Inspector noted LWB rivets were on the very high end of spec. Added 15mm/s to velocity on LWB spots. They measure good now. Rivmon has been taught.

6Y-80-09 – On gun #2 when I got here. Also gun #1 had faulted quite a few times so I could not even go back in the fault history to see exacy what was going on with gun #2. Was told its still giving the max time step 2 faults with a depth of -58mm. Usually indicates an issue with the signal cable but if gun #1 isn’t seen the same issue it may not be it. Could be the ATI on that tool. Will check it out tonight if it’s still left again.

#1 – 6X-20-17 – Head too low – 7x for 26min – Some spots trending on the high end of the tolerance and some spots had some weird spikes in data. Adjusted what we could which seemed to take care of faults few remainder of shift. The extruded parts are troublesome.
 
#5 – 8Y-10-05 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 2x for 13min – Swapped after 2 faults. Went in and checked out the faults for the last 200 on each spot. Seemed only spots 1 and 2 were giving trouble. Increased finale torque 3.25nm to 4nm to help achieve depth. Back on gun #1.
 
7K-30-R01 Gun #1 – Feed fault/Nose switch fault-  8x for 8min – Punch must have been loose because it broke off and broke the nose as well. Replaced GBSD and punch. Punch fragment was stuck in setter which took some time to extract. Once everything was back together we still had feed faults. Noticed the new nose was bent. Replaced nose. Ran a couple parts. More feed faults. Found that nose bent as well. Installed a brand new nose and ran rest of shift. I do not think the nose is hitting anything I think there were junk parts on the buggy that were being installed. Threw away both bent noses.
 
7X-20-R01 – Material too soft – 2x for 5min – Adjusted Rivmon monitoring. These were “new sense” faults.
 
6X-90-04 – Head too high – 3x for 10min – This one has been getting us pretty good this week. Believe it is material related. Hoping to catch a faulted unit and use it as our monthly teardown so I can cross section the joint.
 
#1 – 7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 1x for 54min – The great performance of the stud guns could only last so long. Punch had come loose. Tightened punch and still had faults. Found pusher on feeder was messed up. Had to install a new feeder to run. Still waiting on Henrob report from their visit.
 
8F-150-05/8F-120-04 – Rivmon debacle – 150-05 has been getting us all week and now 120-04 is doing the same thing. Both tools rivet through a common part. Sub assembly date from Thai Summit shows the part as being relatively new. Got with Jeff Epps to see if he can contact Thai Summit to see if they are having issues riveting through the same part. May need to sacrifice a rear ladder to cross section troublesome joint to see if its material or if the rivet is buckling.

It then faulted on 8V405-5L with head too low which read at -.46, button appeared good and tubular rivet had material in hole. Adjusted velocity for both spots reducing it to 270mm/sec from 290mm/sec bringing the head heights to -.21. around 1am 8V405-2R faulted with head too high and read +.16 but hole in rivet had no visible material and button appeared fully formed. I had this repaired because I just wasn't sure.

6X90-5 During monthly teardown it was noted that the roof bow support that goes between the front header and the first roof bow on a base roof LWB u554 all 4 rivets felt as though they pulled apart easily. Upon investigation the button look like it may be short or not fully formed so I went in the line and checked finding the same button appearance. We replaced the die and found the punch loose so it was replaced as well. We took the parts to the P558 lab and cross sectioned one of the rivets. See attached pic. With Mikhail Kachalov's assistance we determined that the rivet was good.

Lined out Joe Jackey and James French to replace the cables Tim Zinkan brought over. 
*I think that is supposed to be 9B-250-5?   Anyway the cables that were given were much too short to go from the Tox controller to the base of the robot.  If is a cable issue, I would think it would more likely be an issue with the cables from the base of the robot thru the Leoni package to the Tox motor.  Jacky and French did find one of the Leoni clamps had come apart and the tubing and cables were hanging loose.  They replaced the missing bolt on the clamp and secured the loose tubing.

FAULTS:
6Y180-2 gun 1 put back on between shifts, we could not get it to run. Gun would go to job and shift forward as expected with a screw in the head assembly but would not rotate. It would then cycle again with the same result. We could not get the gun to cycle even in manual. Going to attempt to swap the gun with a rebuilt spare from the shop so we can test it on the stand. 
 
8F120-4 gun 2 Head too high/low faults, also dropped out with excessive force faults. Turned excessive force monitor off to run. Not sure if the controller had been shut off because that monitor will default to on when power is cycled. Later in the evening at 130am the setter started growling and faulting. Sent the Toolmakers over to replace it. 
 
8F150-5 gun 1 head too high/low faults on LWB only consistent with what we have been seeing for the past several days. Made some velocity adjustments to compensate for a deep rivet. SWB units run very well over there and there is only one different part. See attached pic. I'll send this pic to Jeff Epps to have him request information on the aluminum coil age. Grasping at straws here. BOTH 8F150-5 AND 8F120-4 ARE FAULTING ON THIS PART IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. 
 
6X90-4 Head too high/low faults, added some more squeeze pressure and time to the affected spots. WE REALLY NEED THE DATA FROM CMM IN THE LIFTGATE OPENING. IT HAS TO BE THE EXCESSIVE GAPPING BETWEEN THE VERY THICK PARTS THAT IS CREATING THE FAULT CONDITIONS.

#1 and #5 empty carrier from the pre-load (top) side of the body side conveyor wouldn't leave quickly enough when the stop was opened so when the stop closed the carrier had not cleared and the stop would hit the side of the carrier pin.  This only happened when the conveyor was trying to restart from being completely backed up.  I believe that by having one less carrier in the system we are missing the carrier that has been bumping the pre-unload position carrier past the stop in time.  We put carrier 12 back into the system EOS.

PM's",,,"Framer 2 robot 6X140-6 perceptron cameras started failing on every long U when attempting to deck the roof to the unit.  Chris Lowe came over to assist and help determine that sensor 8 was the camera failing.  Some of its measurements were as much as 12mm out of tolerance.  It failed its calibration at start up and failed on every long unit since.  We cleaned the camera lenses, ran the calibration program, stopped and started services, cycled power to breakers 2 and 6, and rebooted perceptron computer.  All to no avail.   We kept running by decking every long model roof by the load to average on the robot teach pendant.  When production took an early break, Paul went into the cell to verify the sensor part number, when he did, he found one the camera connections damaged and the cord loose.  He was able to secure the cord to the connector.  Then we recalibrated the cameras.  Then none of the cameras calibrated correctly.  None returned any data.  Powered the cameras down and rebooted the perceptron computer.  On the next calibration, all the cameras calibrated except camera 8.  We were back to loading to average on every long U.  Located a replacement camera.    Replaced the camera and cable after shift.  We found the center pin from the cable broken off and stuck in the cable connector.  Ran several jobs to verify.

#1 6X-140-6 continued to have Perceptron issues on 554 LWB today.  Because of the previous shift issues, we were initially focused on sensor #8 for troubleshooting but eventually found out that Perceptron isn’t computing the data from ANY of the sensors for only the 554 LWB.  Perceptron logged into the system remotely and verified that all of the cameras are actually capturing data but they can’t yet explain why we are having the issue just on the 554 LWB.  Logic test edits and robot program edits have been made to automatically load to average AFTER there is a vision fault for ONLY the 554 LWB.  Paul Glardon has been shown all of the changes that were made.  First rotation for auto load to average is 0553.

8Y-10-05 – On gun #2 when I got here. Fault history was full of faults from gun #2. Could not see what was going on with gun #1. Left on gun #2. Dave Joiner is going to work with myself and ELs Sunday night on the 2 UB Weber’s. Will try to set up a bunch of jobs during tonight’s strip out.
 
8Y-10-06 – 15x for 24min (gun #2) – On gun #2 when I got here. Fault history was full of faults from gun #2. Could not see what was going on with gun #1. Left on gun #2. Dave Joiner is going to work with myself and ELs Sunday night on the 2 UB Weber’s. Will try to set up a bunch of jobs during tonight’s strip out.
 
6Y-80-09 – FDS faults – 24x for 1hr2min – On gun #2 when I got here which was running with issues as well. 11pm EL switched to gun #1 to try to fix it. Getting a lot of step 7 max depth exceeded faults with readings indicating the screw wasn’t in the head. Also seeing very stranger occurrences of step 15 max depth exceeded for +2.0mm and there is no screw in the part. This shouldn’t be possible so I have taken photos and will be contacting weber for some assistance. To remedy the step 7 faults the TMs adjusted the floating head assembly between shifts and installed a new bit as the one in it was rounded. As I type this the gun was swapped again so I suppose it did not fix the issue. Will follow up further before I leave. On gun #2 for now.
 
6X-90-04 – Head too high – 6x for 18min – Still having issues with gaps and deformed buttons on the rear header lift gate opening joint. Suspect rotation 0728 is in the line. Would like to pull as a teardown unit and cross section joint to see if rivet is buckling like on 8F-150-05- Pressuring VO for assistance with these joints causing problems.
 
7G-70-R01 – FDS fault – 2x for 1hr53min – Came in to gun #2 running. When they finished production we swapped to gun #1. Couldn’t do an offset due to 4 screws being in the head and one welded to a destroyed bit. Removed head assembly and installed new bit and cleared tool of all screws. Stepped robot through and noticed quite a few spots were hitting clearance hole pretty bad causing the screw to kick and throw sparks from grinding on jaws and bit. French touched up program between shifts. Curreny on gun #1 and ran about 10 parts well.
 
7G-10-L03 – Rivmon head too low – 9x for 1hr11min – Towards end of afternoon shift EL shift he began getting excessive Rivmon faults. Home offset was drifting and he was teaching the joints. Went and saw the home offset drifting almost each part. Homed tool and taught Rivmon numerous times to keep tool limping until production was done. Towards end of shift offset had drifted more than 3mm and the tool began to shotgun on the way down to insert stud. Installed new setter which homed and calibrated well. Ran a handful of verification parts and offset stayed solid. Old setter had slighy less than 500k on it.
 
7K-20-R01 – Weber follow-up – On gun #2 when I got here. Was told when a gun swap was initiated it would not swap to gun #1 because it would not see jaws open. Went to swap and stopped it in middle of process to see what was going on. The rods for the jaws have a lite play in them and when they fell a certain way they would not read the jaw open prox. We moved the prox slighy to read the jaws where it sat at that position. This allowed us to swap. Then we held it on the approach point of spot #1 to troubleshoot the step 4 min depth faults. We manually fed and ejected well over 20 screws and could not get it to hang up once. It is still on gun #1 and will be monitored at start up. If issues continues I will try to get into it this weekend or Sunday night/Monday morning.
 
6Y-180-01 – On gun #2 when I got here. Went and tried to turn the bit and could not move it. Between shifts we swapped guns and I tried to perform a friction test from the Weber. It failed. Pulled transducer and verified it spun freely. This indicates belt is most likely damaged. Swapped back to gun #2 for production. Will pull gun #1 tonight or this weekend and open it up to inspect/replace belt. NO HOT BACK-UP AVAILABLE CURRENY. Do not swap…

 ",,"HFE Sta 20 fixture 1 REO press had several issues.  The escapement kept jamming up and the nut feed arm would not locate the nut on the pin.  Toolmakers worked for several hours trying to sort out the problems.   They found the plunger in the feed arm head was sticking out too far causing the nut from the feed tube to hang up in turn jamming up the escapement.  Adjusted the plunger flush with the feed head.  Then found the plunger would not extending out far enough to fully locate the nut on the pin.  Replaced the plunger spring with a shorter spring to give the plunger more forward travel.  The magnet on the pin that helps secures the nut on the pin may losing some of it magnetism, so a new pin was located.    Also had the similar issues with fixture 2 but not nearly to the extend as fixture 1.

6Y-80-09 – FDS – 2x for 1hr24min – Had issue with material handler. Went to teach but put wrong robot in teach. Crashed Weber gun #2. Brought out and tried to repair with no success. Swapped gun. Could not do swap to gun #1 because we could not get offset to pass. Spent quite some time trying to adjust analog depth sensor to get offset to pass. Was told Paul Glardon just put a new sensor on gun #1 the other day. Sensor didn’t look new. Decided to put sensor off crashed gun #2 on gun #1. Screws stripped on sensor for gun #1. Finally got it off and installed sensor from gun #2. Still could not finish offset procedure. Found sensor was installed upside down. Put sensor right-side up and then tool ran. Gun #1 was still having carry over issues from last week faulting for step 7 max depth exceeded. Screw not making it to nose. Babied it for a while. TMs pulled crashed gun out of cell and put in gun I ran on test stand last night. Switched to the gun from shop and let it run the rest of shift. Gun ran fine. Between shifts swapped back to gun #1 and replaced the rigid feed tube and head. Ran 5 jobs with it with no retries or faults. On gun #2 and has a good back-up.
 
7G-10-L03 – Having issues with setter shot gunning and damaging the studs. It wasn’t just scraping the threads it was actually bending them. Checked punch and it was tight. Replaced the stud feed head and it ran better. Had issue with operator sending suspect parts down the line and building them up into full roof rails so be on the lookout for calls from trim.
 
Phil Frank is staying 4 over. I told him he is to rebuild setters and assist with any emergencies on the floor. 
 ","#2 main.  Closure 1 lift gate robot 4F-30R-04 was in approach position to deck the lift gate where it should be getting information from Perceptron to move to the final decking position when it apparently failed to get information.  The panel view displayed a fault FB1[272].11.   Electricians stopped and started services on the Perceptron computer and the robot.  Fault did not clear and robot would deck the lift gate.  Checked robot controller and found the robot aborted its program it was running.  We attempted to put it back into the correct program to deck the lift gate, but it aborted the program again.  Got the robot back to home and reset end effector, shift register and restarted.  To clear the fault, we reset the accumulated value to the fault timer that drives the fault bit.  
 
#1 and #3 main.  6Y80R-07 crashed while attempting to pick and stuffer palate from the conveyor.  Electrician attempted to move the 80R-07 to clear the crash and instead moved 80R-09 damaging gun 2.  Attempted to repair gun 2 but could not.  Switched to gun 1 and it had issues as well, and would not run.  Replaced analog depth sensor and gun 1 ran but not consistently.   Toolmakers replaced gun 2 with new gun from the shop and installed on the robot to run.

Need Dennis Lambert to run setter rebuild for a few days with all of the apprentices and any extra hands we can come up with. We should pull blue tool coverage for a couple of days if we can handle it while we get our shop back in order. Any thoughts as to why Dennis is no longer keeping the shop in order? I think somebody upset him and I know it was not me. Did anyone do anything to him that may have angered him? Asking for a friend. :-)

#1 (4D) – 8C-10-04 – Nose switch fault – 10x for 1hr15min –  Was down pretty much from 11:22pm-3am. Punch sticking in nose. Swapped punch and it looked okay. Did not fix issue. Still sticking. Swapped GBSD and nose. Did not fix issue. Still sticking. Tried cleaning and greasing the collar of the setter where the GBSD attached (where it was sticking). This did not fix it. Still sticking. Swapped setter. Did not fix issue. Still sticking. After some more trouble shooting swapped nose again. Did not fix issue. Still sticking. Though setter was too tight possible. Went in and broke anti-rotate and setter nut loose. Still did not free it up. Tightened all back down and tried to run. Still sticking. Replaced nose again. Did not fix issue still sticking. Replaced punch again. Did not fix issue. Still sticking. Replaced GBSD again and tool was able to run. 3 GBSDs (including original), 4 noses (including original), 2 setters (including original), 3 punches (including original). I find it hard to believe we had 4 bad noses. I say this because each nose we took off we slid it onto the punch with ease. It only began to stick when mounted to the GBSD. Also find it hard to believe we had 3 bad GBSDs. But it seems as if the mounting hole for the last GBSD we had on the tool was very tight which could have been flexing the mating flange on the nose causing the punch to hang up on it. We did not get it fixed before production left so we were only able to run about 6 parts to verify. We were able to run more than that at one point tonight during the “tebacle” so I cannot say we are 100% good. Monitor.
 
9B-210-01 – Profil stud not made – 11x for 29min – Studs not falling down into the punch head assembly properly. Phil Dahl took head assembly apart and cleaned it up, new jaws and roll pins, cut about a half inch of the end of feed tube. Tube was work and not sitting into the head correcy.
 
8F-130-04 – Excessive tool force/nose switch fault – 2x for 40min – Right after spool change has nose switch faults. Went in and punch was stuck in nose. Suspected it was bent and it had a lite chip on it so we swapped it. While doing this we noticed the rivet present light was stuck on the GBSD. Looked at the nose switch and noticed the spring for it was broken. Swapped GBSD and nose and had no more issues. I believe this may have a been a case of Pulling the rivet in too far or hitting the sprocket valve too many times after the spool change.

panel which did remove the feedback fault. The pallet was then positioned and the line
put back in auto. The pallet then stopped as it was transitioning from station 10 to 20. The
shift register in 20 showed the right model and rotation # but it was noticed that IBSS had
not advanced. The pallet was repositioned into 10 and the tag was read revealing no data
on the tag. Several attempts were made to write the build data to the tag. It was then
noticed that the shift register in 10 was set as a ""No Part"" which was preventing IBSS from
writing data to the tag. Once the shift register was changed to an empty pallet the tag
was written to and the line cycled and IBSS advanced to the next rotation.

Spent some time with Casey Fadden from Henrob at the Stud tools discussing options for correcting the issue with the punch coming loose 3-4 times per shift. I have asked him to have a punch made without the ""Whise Stop"" tapered end, instead make it with a straight shaft and grind a groove in it that looks like this <. 
This will allow the set screw to make contact with 2 points instead of one and will also prevent the punch from being able to get hung up at an angle.

Solid night here in the LUV bodyshop.
 
7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – Afternoon shift EL struggled through his entire shift. This carried over into nights. Once night shift TM came in they swapped stud feeder and found a sliver of metal in the cube escapement preventing us from escaping and shooting a stud out to the gun. Once this was removed and cleaned up the tool ran the rest of the shift without any issues.
 
5B-320-02 – Double rivet – Not a true double rivet. Setter was changed between shifts and started faulted once they switched models. EL wasn’t aware of the swap so they started the process of throwing parts at the tool. Once we got there we taught Rivmon and sent it on its way. No more issues. May need teaching again depending on which models haven’t been captured.

 ",,"Station 4D190 robot 6 faulted with a Tool Change Tool Release Safety Switch Not 
Made, FB2.219.25.   Area electricians thought this was the ATI unlocked switch on 
the robot side tool changer plate, which was not made,  when they thought it 
should have been.  They removed the switch and attempted to adjust it.   After 
determining that switch was not the issue, the switch was reinstalled but not at 
the correct depth, it was too far in.  When the tool changer lock actuated, it 
struck the end of the switch, breaking the end of the switch off in the robot 
side of the tool plate.  The actual problem was the switch on the tool changer 
plate on the fixture side.  It was not reading the Ford tool in position to 
lock.  Electricians noticed the alignment pin holes on the Ford tool were rough 
and dirty.  They cleaned them out with alcohol wipes.  No further issues 
following that.  6 Robot programs on 190R6 were edited to run.  The wait

#1 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS faults – 24x for 51min – Seems they struggled most the shift. As I was coming in they were changing a bit because it had stripped out. Looking at faults appears program 20 on the waterfall of the pan was causing all the problems. It was giving step 14 max torque exceeded faults. Reduced step 13 pressure from 1.4V to 1.0V to work on that. Was not able to run enough jobs to confideny say it fixed it.
 
#2 – 6Y-80-10 – FDS – 2x 29min – Gun was sticking and somehow a few too many screws were sent out to gun. The tool had no GEO’d the stuffer plate but was “skipped” through those spots. Paul Glardon taught the robot home and did a gun change to complete the job. We will clean both guns this weekend.
 
7G-10-L03 – Stud not trapped – 6x for 1hr – Trouble trapping studs. Fought it for a while but eventually replaced the feeder which seemed to fix it.

Faults:
7G20R-1 Tox faulting with Nitrogen Gas Spring not compressed. Cylinder was not stroking fully down. Topped off Nitrogen to 1520psi, no help. Bled and refilled oil in cylinder which took an hour by itself and that corrected the problem. 
 
7L30-2Tox failing tool check max pressure exceeded. Cleaned adhesive from punch and die allowing the tool to run fault free for about 20 minutes, started faulting again so we changed  the punch and die. Ran for about 20 minutes and was faulting again. Shut down the tool check in the Fanuc controller. End of shift we replaced the air line feeding the punch for the tool check that we found to have some adhesive pushed back into it at the punch and also replaced the airline going the rest of the way back just in case it was getting restricted. Validated it with 20 manual checks fault free. Rick from Tox then contacted me and said it could be the pressure switch so just for good measure we changed that as well. 
 
8Y10-6 Max time exceeded step 14 multiple programs. Replaced bit 3 times, 2 times because somehow we managed to send the gun back in and screw on top of a screw. Not sure how this happened but the third time I was there and had him ship the job out and start on a fresh one.

7G-70-R01 – Was swapped to gun #1 just as I got here. Swapped back to gun #2 between shifts in an effort to troubleshoot. Gun went in and threw sparks and destroyed a bit. Went in and saw the program was more than ¼in off location. Put new bit in and sent back in. Same results. Program drastically off again. Installed new head, bit and bushing. Another bit toasted. Stopped and touched up all spots and put another bit in. Not quite sure how the gun got so far off location. Very odd. Monitoring at start up.
 
7B-20-R01 – Feed faults/nose switch faults – 8x for 36min – GBSD swapped between shifts. Didn’t behave. Had to put another GBSD on and then the tool seemed to run fine.
 
Unit 5774 (see attached photos) – Unit failed perceptron and had issues with flow drills in station 180. Stopped at T23 inspection station and noticed that there was a huge gap between the cowl side and the hinge pillar/body side on the LH side. Gap was being caused by a drawn arc stud on the cowl side coming from 558. Appears the stud was either a repair or it had over penetrated to the point where there was so much weld on the backside of the sheet it would not let the body side sit down on the cowl side properly. This caused us to be missing some FDS on the inside of the cowl side from 180-01. With the gap in the material there was no way to repair with a pop rivet. Unit was sent to metal with concern. Need to find a way to cut out or grind off the weld on the back sheet to allow the material to sit flat enough for a pop rivet repair. Only thing I could see is this could be a squeak and rate concern. Will need to be followed up on dayshift by production, repair and joining.

It is still in the mezz because we had it on the inspection pull off station and did not get repaired until later in the day. Should hit metal where it's still in QLS and I think it could use a lite weld to shore it up where we couldn't get rivets.

#3 – 8Y-20-05 – Head too high – 5x for 25min – I was confused.. Thought someone was whising at me. Turned around to find it was the setter. Randomly started faulting on every spot. End distance had dived off. Limped it through shift. Swapped between shifts at only 198k cycles. Setter has been sent to FRACAS. First rotation of new setter that needs to be checked is 6205.
 
#5 – 8Y-20-01 – Nose switch fault – 3x for 20min – GBSD was swapped between shifts. Had less than 300 cycles on it. Nose switch had no spring back. Swapped GBSD and nose. We will be having an intervention and enforcing a “sign off” procedure when testing GBSDs because clearly it is not being done. TMs - 1…JEs – 0.
 
#6 – 6X-20-01 – Multiple rivets – 1x for 10min – Started with rivet not trapped. Reset for multiple rivets. TMs came and cleared rivets. Runnin and gunnin now.
 
8X-85-04 – Inspector identified segments that were thin on SWV side sill. EL went in and raised the point on the program. When watching to validate we noticed the nozzle was smashing and dragging the side sill along nearly the entire path for SWB and on some spots on LWB. No clue how long it has been running like that. Held jobs and touched up between shifts.
 
5J-40-03 – Material too hard – 8x for 1hr3min – Faulting pretty consisteny. When I went to check it out noticed setter was grinding pretty bad. Faults were due to peak force trending high. We averaged that out to keep it running. Setter swapped and sent to FRACAS between shifts. Setter had 778k cycles.
 
Unit 5774 – Made it to metal. Repair welded around the perimeter of coupon to make it solid and we sent it. Yeeeeeeeah.

Unload operator checked all parts as they came out of the cell and did not find any more. Went over to framer and checked what they had online and did not find any either.

Will investigate further tonight.
 
RH 553 SWB Wheelhouse Hem – Was notified 3 units made it to paint with open hems. Started checking what we had in shop and did not find any open here in bodyshop. While looking we found a condition that could cause open hem if it was any worse. Appears the wheelhouse inner is long leaving an overlap on the bodyside outer. I could see if this condition was bad enough it would not allow the tool to fold that flange over and create a good hem. Chris Lowe is looking into this condition. We will continue to check for open hems. Working with metal repair on how we are going to fix the open hems in paint shop. From what I understand its not going to be easy.","#2 PP is for an operator installed baffle that wasn't seated properly

#1 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS process faults – 11x for 38min – Dave had issues right at startup which accounted for over 30min of the downtime. The remainder of the shift we only had 2 more faults. Appears the adjustments made to the gun and parameters by Dave took care of the issue they saw at start up.
 
#3 – 6X-180-01 – Head too high – 7x for 21min – Faults on numerous spots. Nothing really consistent. Adjusted nominal end distance on spots that were showing a trend.
 
#5 – 6X-90-02 – Toolcheck NOK – 1x for 13min – Broke another TOX SKB die. Swapped and ran.
 
#6 – 7X-20-L02 – Head too high – 3x for 9min – Faulting on spots 2 and 94. End distance trending low. Adjusted on all spots to avoid further faults.
 
7X-20-L03 – Feed fault – 4x for 3min – Really lost nearly an hour. Had a feed fault due to spool being twisted. After it tried to pull so much a rivet was lodged in the nose causing a double rivet. This bent the punch and damaged the nose. TMs called to change GBSD, nose and punch. Spool has been set aside for Epps to grab.
 
6W-60-04 – Head too low – 3x for 4min – Faulting on a few spots. Noticed home offset was a bit off. Tried to re-home and could not get a good offset. It will run like this without issues but if home offset continues to drift we may need to swap the setter.
 
Rotation 6811 – LH bodyside outer rocker flange trimmed short towards rear of cab. This caused all rivets on this flange to come up suspect as they were missing a sheet. Notified team leader who had the stamping person start checking that flange while checking for splits. Unit will need a weld along the flange. Unit in front of metal now is 6773 so we have about 4 jobs before unit hits repair. Will need follow up.

Working on rebuilds",,,Had an encoder error on 7K-30R-1 gun 1 at startup of production on Saturday night.  Tool was faulted with the robot sitting at the home position.  Because of the encoder error the robot wouldn't come to maintenance w/o tool in auto.  Had to teach the robot to drop off.  Then we couldn't unlock the tool because the lock signal was being held on by the robot and all of the robot IF screen functions wouldn't work because of the encoder error.  Had to remove ATI power to allow us to use the manual override to unlock.  Replaced the EC6T module once the tool was seperated.  Verified the encoder error is indeed what was preventing us from being able to unlock by removing the encoder cable at end of shift and saw that all the symptoms were the same.  Need to have Risinger look at the robot PMC to find a way to keep manual control of the tool changer even when the attached tool is faulted.  Also need to change the PLC program to allow bringing the robot to maintenance position from the HMI while the attached tool is faulted.

6X-100-04 – Head too high – 1x for 16min – Started faulting every spot for every job. End distance had dover off screen. Home offset was at 4.7mm so we tried to re-home but were unable to and got “abs pos invalid” faults. Determined we were going to change setter. Tool was running a black setter with only 44k cycles on it. When we went in we found the setter had broken loose at the nut between the two halves. The setter nut at the nose was also finger tight. We went and re-torqued everything, homed and calibrated and tool ran fine. Ran into a lite snag when the ELs went to touch up maintenance program but that’s good now.
 
OPEN PICK-UP – 53 Jobs – 6X-80-03 (14 rivets per job) – Inspector sent me photos of an odd looking button. It was clear die was broken.

We began containing units both at T23 and up in the mezz around Z28. Repair is 9 SPRs (EN rivet, DP11-200 die) and 5 pop rivets. 7867 is stopped in the mezz and will be the first needing repair. First good coming to mezz is 7874 so there will only be 6 more to do upstairs. 7891 is stopped at T23 and will be needing repair. Leaving 16 more jobs to repair at T23.

8A-100-01 – SPAC nut “tebacle” – 1x for 2hr25min – Appears “something” happened just before afternoon shift EL left. Panel view showed faults beginning at 10:49pm. Night shift EL came in to find the ram on the SPAC nut press advanced down crashing into the feed arm and part. Teach pendant was on top of robot controller and cord was on floor so not sure what got us to that point but we began to work on it. TMs were called to replace feed arm and inspect rest of press. Took us some time to get the part out of the way but eventually we did. TMs tried to bring the arm back so they could access all the hardware to remove it but could not do so without prying on it and hammering it because it was bent so bad. Finally got the bent arm off the tool and installed the new arm. Once we did that we could not get the nuts to advance from the track into the jaws. The jaws and track were not lining up. Tried to adjust the travel on the arm with no success. It was then we noticed the track was knocked out of alignment during the crash as well. We loosed the bolts and gave it a few smacks with a hammer and snugged everything back down. Nuts began to feed into the jaws properly. Ran parts manually to verify alignment was good. Went to put back into auto but faults were latched from original crash because SPAC did not get cycle complete. Dug into logic and got that all reset and then the cell ran fine rest of shift.

6X-20-02 – Head too low – End distance was off by over 0.5mm. Rivets were deep. Ended up finding out magazine was swapped the other day. In doing so somehow the feed tubes for the rivets were swapped or maybe the mag was not empty. Where there should have been a EN rivet there was a QE and vice versa. EL had sent 5 suspect jobs before I was notified. We went in a verified the feed tubes and then manually emptied the magazine completely and refilled it with the proper rivets. Tool is fine now. This could have went very badly if Joe Thompson wouldn’t have thrown up the red flag and did a “teach last” or “teach 100”..need to find out how things got mixed up and discuss with the person that did it. Suspect rotations 9735, 9736, 9737, 9738 and 9739 will need 100% repair from 6X-20-02.

Nights – Snyder
Channeling my inner Molly Hatchet I decided to “flirt with disaster” and swap all Weber guns to gun #1 tonight at or around lunch. We had great success with the exception of 4 tools. All issues have been addressed and tools are all curreny ready to go on gun #1.
 
#2 – 6X-20-06 – Escapement not at mid/Snowball “tebacle” – 1x for 1hr – Began issue with escapement faults. Could not get escapement to cycle. Manually emptied all rivets from magazine and removed the escapement cylinder and gate. Toolmakers cleaned up the gate and cylinder. While removing it we found the “rivet in escapement” sensor had fallen out due to the screw that holds it in being loose. When this screw was loose it caused the small holder for the sensor to fall out of place which is what caused the escapement to bind up in the first place. Installed the sensor and holder correcy and put tool back together to run. Began getting “probe B” faults due to the magazine probe not seeing its forward position. Pipefitting went in and found the push lock fitting for the probe was crushed. Did not have a fitting so we took one off a mag in the shop. While replacing the broken fitting the second fitting for the probe was broken. Replaced second fitting. Sent tool back in and got another “probe B position” fault. Noticed light on the probe position prox was not on. It was knocked loose while changing the fittings. Set the prox and then the tool ran. While running we noticed it was in a limp mode and was firing the probes each time it riveted because it was not seeing a rivet in the escapement. This caused a couple more probe position faults. We limped it through the end of shift and then manually emptied the mag again so we could take the escapement apart and adjust the rivet in escapement prox in further. We validated the adjustment on 2 units and did not see the tool running in the same limp mode any longer. All sensors and cylinders appear to be working fine now.
 
#3 – 6Y-180-01 – Step 14 max torque exceeded – 1x for 21min – Swapped to gun #1 around lunch and immediately saw a fault on this tool. When it went in to do the cowl top screw it kicked the screw sideways and fused the screw to the bit. Tool also was giving a lot of step 7 max depth faults. Noticed that gun #1 had a short foot on it which is what caused the screw to kick sideways. Did not have any long feet in the shop so we took it off gun #2 for 180-02. Once we swapped the bit and the foot we attempted to do an offset but it failed because the tolerances were set for a short foot and would not pass the long foot offset. We adjusted the analog depth sensor to get this to work and then the gun took off and ran fine. We have no more 25mm feet…had to rob one off a gun in the shop in order to make 180-02 whole again. We have open orders hanging out for these note sent to Snively and company.
 
8Y-10-05 – FDS min depth not reached – Swapped to gun #1 and saw some faults almost immediately. Switched back to make it through shift. Josh McClure is touching up programs between shifts. Inspectors reported that suspect screws were all seated fine so if issues persist we may be able to do some parameter work arounds.
 
7K-40-R08 – FDS – 3x for 8min – Swapped to gun #1 and failed offset. Analog depth sensor was loose. Adjusted sensor and then offset passed fine. Ran well rest of shift.
 
6X-80-03 – Time delay exceeded/feed faults – 3x for 5min – EL called me because he said setter was acting weird and causing time delays. Ended up finding it was just doing an auto recovery and the retries were turned up to 7 on the Henrob causing the robot to time out. Spool was almost empty which was probably causing the issue with the tape pull but we went ahead and swapped the GBSD and nose anyway. Limp mode = gonezo.
 
6Y-100-06 – Feed fault – 1x for 4min – EL did a spool change and did not have it engaged on the sprocket. Correct that and issue went away.
 
#6 – 7G-70-L02 – Tool pickup timeout – 1x for 33min – Went to swap over to gun #1. During tool change the feed tube got stuck between the robot and the gun ATI. When this happened it also ripped out the electrical connector on the EN30M ATI robot side module. Phil Dahl did a great job patching this up to keep us running by filing a new groove into the connector for the snap ring to lock onto. Once we got it all put back together and the hoses moved slighy we swapped again and did not see any issues. Damaged module was replaced between shifts.

The sharp angle of the supply hose going through the horn on that bracket appears to be exactly where the failed hoses had burnt.  See pictures.

8Y-10-05 – FDS faults (mosy all step 15 min depth not reached) – 8x for 18min – Was on gun #2 still. Swapped over to gun #1 around 11:30pm and let it run the rest of the shift (40-50 jobs). By the end of it all we made over 30 parameter adjustments to numerous spots. Before making any changes we went in and checked out the screw to ensure it was not sitting high or missing a hole. Adjustments made were primarily to the depth target in 15, depth target in 14, torque in 15 and RPM in 14 and 15. Inspectors followed up all of the changes on suspect units by checking the screws and did not find any that were bad. Details on all the changes can be found on the Weber HMI logbook. If it does not work swap it again and we will continue to troubleshoot tonight again.
 
7K-20-L01 – FDS faults – 5x for 3min – Was on gun #2 when I got here. Fault data appeared to show some issues with recovery (double screws in head).

Jelley and Elkins were investigating how the Leoni housing got damaged on 6X190-3 last week.  During their investigation they found a scenario that while 190-3 is performing its tape cut and 190-5 is riveting, they can contact each other.  Jelley says we added an additional rivet to 190-5 in the rear window opening a few months back.  Apparently we have zones programmed in for the riveting but did not add a zone for 190-3 while in tape cut.  They moved the 190-3 tape cut position slightly to miss 190-5.  The Leoni housing on 190-3 is cracked but otherwise fine, it does not need replaced currently.  But they noticed damaged done to one of the minor axis encoder.  It will need to be replaced.

Spent most of beginning of evening over in 558 again.
 
5C-40-01 – Had a weird thing happen. Began with feed fault. Which then was followed by nose switch faults and multiple dry fires from nose switch fault being reset. Found punch was bent which was causing the feed issues. However….for some reason FFR “skip once” was latching up in the robot causing the Henrob to go through its motions and not rivet creating suspect parts every single time which had to be removed from the line. Once we ran HOME I/O on the robot the issue went away. I have never seen FFR latched up on a robot like this.

We made some adjustments to the front door line robot 200R01 end effector E2 that picks up the left side outer door skins from the gravity conveyor.  We added an additional vacuum generator and suction cup to better hold the upper, rear window opening frame on the left front door.  We also added an additional prox switch under the locating pin that is supposed to hit the hole in near the mirror mount in the front of the door.  We are currently using an 8mm sensing range prox switch.  Yesterday I saw several examples of where the locating pin missed the hole, but the door skin flexed enough around the pin, that the two common prox switches made up, and the door skin clamped up.  And headed to the sealer stand, breaking the nozzle.  The two cube part present switches have a  50mm sensing range.  They need to be changed to switches with less range.  Hopefully this added part present will keep the door skin from clamping up if the pin misses the hole.  It is programmed into the PLC in series with the other two part present switches so all three have to be made.  Our new prox switch bracket needs to be a little more robust, so Mitch will get the toolies to begin working on a new one Sunday night.   We did a little more tweaking and ran about 100 left front doors with our new switch and suction cup Saturday night.  All went well.  Had one door that the pin missed the hole, and our new prox switch caught it.  Maybe this will save a few nozzles.

#1 – 8Y-10-06 – Brake not ret/Hold down device not ret – 4x for 52min – First occurrence was the brake not ret. This was due to EL valving the brake, not returning it and leaving the valve on. Before I could get there the gun was swapped because of this. Second fault there were too many screws in the nose causing the tool to jam. This was reset a few times so the jaw/head broke and would not hold a screw. TM had to come swap head. Let it run on gun #2 rest of shift without issue. Went in between shift and found the valve left on which took care of gun #1. Running on gun #1.
 
#5 – 6X-80-04 – Feed fault – 3x for 15min – Spool was almost empty and tape was struggling to feed through nose. Changed spool and blew out nose and wiped it with wipe. No more faults rest of shift.
 
8X-100-06 – Head too low – 4x for 7min – End distance slighy out. Verified rivets and adjusted.
 
7X-30-L01 – Head too low – 9x for 7min – End distance trending high. Verified rivets and adjusted.
 
6X-20-04 – Pusher not retracted – 4x for 7min – Pusher moving very slowly. Swapped feedstick. Wibbels rebuilding feedstick.
 
7G-10-R03 – Stud not trapped – 4x for 50min – Walked in to some fun over there. Feeder swapping. Stud threads crushed. Shotgunning. Stud not trapped faults. Jeff Lindzy changed the feeder 3 times. By this time night shift TM was here. I had him babysit it but he did not have another fault the rest of the shift. Maybe the 4th feeder fixed it? The world will never know.
 
7A-30-L01 – Dock tube sensor – 2x for 29min – Robot was dancing. Tube had backfilled with rivets. Called PF to clear out rivets. Put back together and manually filled. Ran fine after this.
 
9A-30-01 – Feed issues – 1x for 30min – Feed arm was jammed up at the punch due to multiple attempts with jammed nut. Got that all cleared and then the escapement was jammed due to retries with jammed nut. Got that cleared and then escapement was valved too many times causing another jam. Cleared again and ran.

I think we could get rid of the faults by increasing that timer if the cycle time is there. Or maybe compare it to a timer on another FDS in the shop and see if there is something wrong.

And I believe it was swapped last weekend. Will monitor closely to see if its just poor rebuilds or something wrong with the tool set-up.
 
#4 – 7X-30-L04 – Tool change communication faulted – 5x for 15min – Seeing these faults still which then are followed by double rivets. Cleared rivets from nose. ELs had a robot side ATI module so they started swapping that. Swapped tool side between shifts. Monitor.
 
#10 – 6X-20-17 – Head too lo2 – 6x for 11min – Adjusted end distance nominal.
 
5B-210-01 – Broke an adhesive nozzle tonight. Still attributing this to reworked door skins.
 
7K-20-R06 – Setter swap – Swapped setter for blue setter for 1MC PM. GBSD was also almost due so we swapped that as well. First rotation 9122 will need to be verified by inspectors.
 
UB pull-out lift – Lift release cable is frayed and will probably snap shory. Did not get around to locating millwrights to work on this tonight. If you got time please have someone check it out.
 
EL did not report any head not back faults tonight. Will continue to monitor.",,,,,,"Night shift team leader for the moon roof operation would like to know what happened to the stand that held the moon roof rings that was located at the operation between V33 and W33.

6X-170-02 – Follow up – Heard die broke today. Never had an issue before… We swapped this die this past weekend and now we broke one. I suspected poke yoke was missing. Shonufff…poke yoke was gone. Must have been beaten out with a hammer when they removed the die. Luckily we had ONE in the cabinet in the shop. Stores shows a balance of one. Poke yoke installed between shifts. Gave a speech to all night shift TMs ensuring they understanding a poke yoke is required to be on all dies and if it comes out when they remove a die it needs to be re-installed. Same discussion needs to happen with the other shifts. Also probably should do a audit of the shop during shutdown to check for missing poke yokes.

 ",,,"Discovered an issue in underbody shortly after start up when we had an AVS/ shift register mismatch on lift table #5 in the pallet pull out area.  Found the underbody decoupler was inadvertently placed in straight thru mode while it held loaded pallets.  This most likely happened Friday night after production.  We had 4 underbodies out of sequence with the rest.  Skipped AVS forward to clear the faulted unit on lift table #5 and run them, and released the bypassed underbodies from the decoupler.  Then skipped the AVS backward once the out of sequence underbodies arrived at lift table #5.  Once they were thru, skipped AVS back forward to match in the next correct unit in sequence.  The body sides for the out of sequence underbodies were built.  Ed Dohn, team leaders, and joining inspectors removed the out of sequence body sides from the carriers on the body side conveyor and set them aside.   Ran and decked the body sides for the next units in line.  When we were ready for the four out of sequence underbodies,  we release 4 empty carriers to the conveyor and the group then placed the pulled off body sides onto the empty carriers in the correct sequence.   Electricians then matched the shift registers and tags up at the conveyor unload stop.  It all worked well.  This all took a team effort, especially from Ed Dohn.    Logic changes will be made Sunday night to the underbody respot decoupler and underbody main decoupler so they cannot be placed in straight thru mode while containing loaded units.   Unless the units are empty pallets or damaged units.

#2 – 8C-10-01 – 4PX PP not on – 2x for 35min – First call the TMs went in and checked the cylinder. It was bound but only due to the fact the nuts were pressing back down from being stuck at the head. They went to head and removed the track that transitions the nut from the chuting to the punch area. Took it apart and cleaned/filed it slightly. Within 5min we had another fault same thing…Told them to check for upside down nuts. Emptied out the chuting and found a few upside down nuts in the chuting. Once nuts were cleared and chute filled back up we ran without issue. Bowl vibration was not turned up so I am not sure how upside down nuts were introduced to the system. I am going to verify but I believe there is a last line of defense error proofing in the Arnold nut feeders in 558 that will prevent upside down nuts from making it to the escapement. If this is missing we will get with MTS to fix it.
 
#4 – 8Y-110-03 – Feed fault – 2x for 27min – Tape chewed up. TMs and PF were called to change GBSD. GBSD swapped and still faulting. Tape looked same. Went in and found sprocket pressure was 15psi lower than the pressure at install. Upped pressure and tape began to feed and look better. Methodical approach needs to be taken to any air pressure adjustments. It takes time to dial in pressure to run with full and low spools. It should be last thing adjusted. It may work for the time being but it could also be masking a GBSD issue and will cause us more downtime down the line.
 
#7 – 6X-20-01 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 19min – EL went in and tried to manually trap rivet but accidently sent 2. TMs were called to clear multiple rivets from feed stick. Sent back in and immediately got a pusher not retracted fault. Brought out to maintenance and pusher would not move when valved. Started fiddling around with SMC cylinder for the pusher and it started moving. Looks like an air line was punched when putting it back together. Monitor.
 
#9 – 6X-60-04 – Spindle not RET/Hold down device RET not reached – 5x for 14min – Afternoons swapped to gun #1. At lunch we swapped to gun #2 and saw similar faults. Hold down device sticking. The spindle faults were concerning because that usually indicates a signal problem. TMs came over and took it all apart…cleaned and lubed the head, linear bearing rails and the main cylinder for the spindle. This took care of the faults for the rest of the shift. Still on gun #2. Monitor.
 
#3 – 9A-10-02 – Feed fault – 3x for 21min – GBSD was at 529k cycles. Went ahead and swapped it out.
 
#6 – 5J-210-01 – Feed fault – 1x for 16min – GBSD at 35k cycles. Wouldn’t make nose switch. Swapped and ran.
 
Pallet Pins – Called to UB by inspector to check pallet pin that would not move. Was seized up pretty good. Could get it to move slightly by hitting it with hammer. TMs took apart and cleaned. It was full of metal and what appeared to be gummed up adhesive. Inspectors said there are quite a few that are difficult to actuate but this one was one of the worst. Is there a PM for these? If not would like to set something up. This is most likely the root cause for any and all UBs that are not set down completely on the pallet causing bodysides to be off location.

#4 – 8Y-10-06 – Step 14 max time – 11x for 21min – Rounding off screw heads and eventually wore out bit. Swapped bit and adjusted some pressures in step 13 and depth targets in step 14. Monitoring those changes curreny. Only other thing I can think of is the screw spots being programmed to close to the part.
 
7K-40-L02 – 9x for 24min – EL reported issues feeding screw out to nose. Went to do a swap but the gun in stand had valves on which led to a lite bit of a lengthy troubleshooting scenario. Running on gun #1 for now. Will work on Sunday night or this weekend. Put TMs on finishing up PMs instead.
 
7B-110-14 – Had to adjust max force on spot 24 because it was barely out of tolerance. Seemed to fix issue.
 
7B-110-13 – Noticed toolcheck minimum was set to ZERO bar. Increased pressure which then caused toolcheck to fail. Punch was worn pretty bad. Changed punch but did not correct issue. No punch stripper assemblies in stores so we had to run with the bad one. Toolcheck set to 0.2bar at the moment. Inspectors will need to keep an eye on the parts.

Checked to make sure all valves are functioning. Checked hoses to make sure nothing was getting pinched or leaking. Nothing found. Ran out onto job and put in hold to make sure the gun was not being held back by anything. All looked good and we ran a few jobs without issue. Could potentially be the cable is dropping signal to fire valve or the vale pack itself is sticking… Gun looks fine and mechanically moves okay. Will swap and follow up tonight.
 
6Y-90-04 – Crash – From what I understand robot was at zero position. Job went to transfer in station and pallet smashed into Henrob gun. Nothing was damaged. Unit looked good.

5B-40-03 – Limp mode – Tool is struggling to pull tape when spool gets below half way. This increased cycle time drastically and causes feed faults.

8Y-90-01 – Head too high – 7x for 14min – Adjusted end distance nominal on spots that were consisteny high.
 
6X-20-17 – Head too high – 6x for 13min – Spikes in end distance were too drastic to adjust to.
 
7K-20-L06 Gun #1 – Lost at least 30min+ on this tool (emptied overhead conveyor). Started with abs. pos. invalid faults that eventually led to excessive deviation faults. Home offset was jumping all over the place each rivet. Checked all encoder cables for damage and tightness. No issues found. Replace BLACK setter at 402k cycles and that cleared up issue. BLACK setter has been tagged and sitting in FRACAS cage.
 
7A Mag-2-Tape – All work to the tools has been completed and validated on coupons. We then tried to run parts in auto. Ran into quite a few programming glitches…tool looking for mag fill and tape cut but not set up to do so it appears. Also all tools were throwing rivmon faults because end distance was off by 9-10mm. We re-homed and calibrated each tool and verified rivets. All were good. Only thing I can think of is there is a difference in the spacers or something. Henrob says it’s all the same but I can’t figure out why the data would jump by 10mm just after the changeover. I could spend some more time checking it out but had to go to LHBS breakdown.
 
8A-110-01 – Operator called and said we are losing 15-20 pans an hour because the gun was running slow. This tool has been known to go into the auto recover limp mode when spool gets low. Watched it run and it was doing that exact thing. This is a rather large ped gun and the partials were set as low as they could possibly be (30mm). Adjusted partials to 100mm and the tool ran fine without every retrying again. Verified we were still more than 22 seconds under cycle so the larger partials shouldn’t be an issue.",,,"Replaced supply sealer hose on left body sides robot 7L20L08 between shifts.

7K-40-L02 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 3x for 5min – EL swapped to gun #1 for rest of shift. Between shifts checked it out. Found we were out of depth window on one program by 0.10mm. Adjusted step 7 depth on that one program. Still on gun #1. Confident it can go back on gun #2 but if you want to leave it for me tonight that’s fine.
 
6Y-150-02 – Rivmon – Tools end distance spikes quite frequeny and it is just barely out of tolerance. Adjusted end distance nominal to 0.4mm above and below to accommodate spikes just like we do on a couple other tools. Rivets checked out good. Rotation 4488 was checked and verified when sent suspect.
 
5C-200-01 – Inspector identified ~50-80mm skip on the rear window flange hem adhesive on 553/554 SWB doors. Tried adjusting numerous things with no luck. Only thing that ultimately fixed issue was slowing down robot path and adjusting accuracy in the path moves. Door looks good now.
 
7A – Joe Jackey identified the maintenance positions (reel change) not being ideal. You have to squeeze between the robot and the ped to change the spool. I informed him we could find an EL to fix that. He didn’t want to do it while they were running so that 5min touch up will need to be done on both LH and RH 30-01 before we tear cell out. There is nothing else moving in the area so it can be moved pretty much anywhere we want. Also turned auto tape cut off on the peds for now to keep the area from being polluted with clippings.

Toolmakers relocated the red net blocks on the left front door stabilizers at the pickup position from the gravity conveyor to stabilize the outer door skin better.  The net blocks were both below the A post locating pin hole at the mirror mounting area on the door skin.  Both were moved up to where one is beside and one is below the locating pin hole.  The hope is the upper A post part of the door skin can no longer bend out of the way if the locating pin misses the hole, the prox switch should not make.  We ran several doors without issues and checked the sealer path.   All looked good.

7X-20-L03 Gun #2 – Walked in on the tail end of a setter swap. Tool was getting “excessive deviation” faults and not homing out properly. TMs had trouble getting setter off because it was seized up not allowing them access to the GBSD. They eventually had to take the GBSD apart in order to remove setter. The motor would not turn at all. Setter had 482k cycles at only 58kN. Setter has been tagged and sent to FRACAS. Setter swap was followed by encoder faults on both tools. ELs pointed out Leoni was coming apart and there was some wear on the cables so we routed a 10M encoder cable from J3 to gun. Faults continued so we dropped the tool off to inspect ATI module. Found pin on robot side was not seated/possibly damaged. Swapped EC6M and faults went away.
 
6X-20-12 – Feed faults – Afternoon shift EL texted me saying he had been fighting feed faults all night. Sent TMs and PFs over to change GBSD and nose only for the EL to send them off because it was running at the moment. Ran fault free rest of shift but if it starts acting up again go ahead and swap the GBSD and nose out.
 
8Y-110-03 – Rivet buttons look turrrrible. Afternoon shifts TMs aligned it and verified with coupons. Coupons looked good but still looked bad on unit. McClure touched up both models. He said quite a few spots weren’t normal to metal. Have inspectors check to see if there is any improvement.

HFE 25mm screw conversion – 9A-40-01 is all changed over and has been verified in teach and automatic. Good to go. Hopper needs to be emptied and vacuumed out still. 9A-40-02 I could not get offset to pass with short or long foot. Nothing I tried was successful. Robot is in hold. Long foot is on tool but still needs work. I plan on continuing tonight when I come in.",,,,,,"8F100-3 Rear Ladder had to be remastered after battery replacement.  Mastering was completed by Hulak and Lindley and robot was verified to metal.
 
During PM inspection of lift tables in the mezz at BB38/37, millwright found a cut place in one of the two lifter belts.  Not sure what is causing it.  The cut is in line with the flange of the roller above it, but not sure how they can contact each other.  Leadec has the mezz locked out currently so we cannot cycle the tables.   Need help determining what is causing the cut.  It is on table 53, 54, and 55.  Probably on 56 and 57 too.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Parts:,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HFE – 21 to 25mm screw conversion is complete on both 9A-40-01 (verified in auto) and 9A-40-02 (needs to be verified in auto). Both tools have long foot installed, parameters changed, hoopers have been completely cleaned out and refilled with long screws. Changed labels on cube to correct screw and left notes on stock near line. Not sure who to talk to about usage update but that will need to be done. We no longer use any 21mm (Green label W718636) screws in the shop.

The pipefitters will then mount the ply wood tops to their lazy Susans.  If we can get some sheet metal screws from tinners or the carpenters for mounting purposes that would be great.  
If we have Tinners, the electrical panel cover at K23 needs some work, or a new one fabricated.
All elevators with the exception of the one at AA40 have had the drives swapped and have been tested in manual.   Where possible we have cycled the elevator one way in automatic.  Where main and stand by VFD’s are installed, they have been swapped as well. 
Millwrights have been inspecting and installing new 2019 stickers on overhead hoists and rails end stops.  We do not have the PM’s for all of them.  It would be nice if Koontz could generate the PM’s of all of them,
Then we could inspect and label all the hoists and rails in the shop all at once.

 ","Nights – Snyder – Start-Up Woes
Went a bit better than expected but still a few issues.
 
Toolmakers worked on last minute project work handed out so PMs werent worked on. They also helped out quite a bit with the rough start up and went through and completed date stamps for todays run.
 
Webers – All on gun #1 and running as far as I am aware. Was a bit of a chore to get 7G and 6Y-180. Robots were left in teach in the middle of programs without guns and were being told they had a gun and to go to maintenance with the gun. Took a while but got everything sorted out and set up correcy.
 
6Y-100-06 – Rivmon – Shows a new setter count but this is the black that was at 1 million and needed greasing. Never got confirmation if that was done or not. Rivets looked good. Was put into teach 100. Suspect rotation 7533.
 
6Y-110-06 – Rivmon – New setter rivmon faults. Rivets looked good. Put into teach 100. Suspect rotation 7532.
 
6Y-110-03 – Feed faults – New GBSD. Feed fault on first 2 rivets. Tried running fresh tape in. Didn’t fix it. Swapped GBSD and tool ran.
 
6X-20-03 – Pusher not retracted – New feeder installed over shutdown. Didn’t run one rivet and got pusher not retracted faults. Valved it and pusher wouldn’t move. Heard air leaking. Blue pusher back hose on feedstick had a large split in it. PF came and spliced hose with a 5/32 push lock air coupling. Good to go.
 
8G-410-01 – Excessive deviation/Abs. pos. invalid – New setter installed (1 rebuild on it). First rivet got excessive deviation faults and setter seized up on the part. Had to take a large pipe wrench to the flywheel in order to wind the motor back. Swapped setter, homed/cal and ran. New setter had rivmon faults. Rivets looked good. Put into teach 100. Old setter has been taken to crib. Was going to FRACAS but the data on the sticker is horrible so I’m not sure where it originally came from and what issues it originally had.
 
7K-40-L08 – Had a bunch of screws jammed in it somehow. Cleared those and it ran fine.
 
8Y-40-06 – Rivmon – Brian Huff said tool was in maintenance mode. Change log showed home and calibration was done the 28th but setter count was not reset. Setter shows up on our list of swapped setters but need to verify if setter was actually swapped. It shows 124k cycles on it. Anyway….rivets looked good so it was put into teach 100. Suspect rotation 7614.
 
8Y-80-01 – Setter is screaming pretty loud. Keep an eye on it.
 
7K-40-R02 – Had quite a few BT3 faults at first. Seemed it was out of sequence somehow because it kept trying to feed screws even after we satisfied the BT3 condition. Ended up getting a bunch at head. Cleared them and started fresh. Ran 3 parts without issue.

While troubleshooting the west side drive found the 480V motor leads in the cabinet were not wired correctly.  They were wired to a terminal block that went nowhere.  The encoder switch that switches the encoder between the main and standby motors does not switch.  It gets its signal from two relays that switch with drives,  they are not wired correctly.  And the encoder wiring is reversed at the encoder switch, main encoder to the standby terminal and vice versa.    Huff working to correct the issues.  Don’t see how this drive could have ever worked since it was upgraded.

Subs
#1 – 9A-10-02 – Head too low – 7x for 56min – Kept getting faults on numerous spots due to end distance spiking. Had to open up end distances tolerances more than I would like to keep it running. Some were already blown open way too far so I brought them down. Had talk with ELs in area and told them not to be opening them up and to send any faulted part as suspect every single time.
 
5B-50-03 – Double rivet – 1x for 15min – Station go out of sequence with nut running. EL had set some cycle completes which caused part to go back in to be re-riveted after it was already done. TMs were called to clear the double rivet and then I showed the ELs how to get out of the double rivet scenario from there and for future reference.
 
Spoke to French and Jackey and informed them their assigned TM will no longer be there and we still expect the area to run just as good.

Day-shift needs to continue with 100% inspection on both UB main load and UB front ladder unload.

#1 – 8C-10-01 – SPAC PP not on – 5x for 57min – Fought it a few times but eventually had to remove the tube and clear everything out and go through the process of waiting for it to fill. I am 90% we are missing an error proofing piece on the track transitioning to the escapement that would keep us from getting nuts upside down in the tube. I am going to deep dive this a bit further and get with MTS if that is indeed the case.

#2 – 7X-20-L01 – Head too high – 2x for 23min – One fault we were tied up on 7K-40-L08 for a while. Went over and investigated why this tool kept getting rivmon faults and noticed the velocity was jumping up and down. Only reason I can think this is happening is the tool is briefly loosing communications while riveting. Need to monitor this as we have seen it happen before with the ATI.
 
#8 – 7K-40-L08 – FDS – 3x for 15min – Not sure where the fault began but poor recovery led to about 8 screws jammed out in the head. Tool was wanting a clear screw at nose but we couldn’t satisfy this condition because of the jam and it was in the middle of a job. TMs came and replaced head and bit. Running fine now.
 
7K-20-R06 Gun #1 – Feed faults – 12x for 9min – EL kept tool limping until TMs could get in and change GBSD. GBSD was pretty gummed up. Ran well after swap.

#1 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS  faults – 35x for 1hr – At lunch went in and touched up programs. This helped quite a bit but still had to tweak some parameters. Ran well the last 2 hours. Not able to swap to gun #2 because ATI is 180 degrees turned. The swap was attempted on days causing almost all the connectors to be broken and damaged on the tool-side ATI.

7K-20-L01 Gun #1 – Crashed gun twice. Spindle retract sensor was staying made so the robot though the gun was home and it wasn’t causing it to rip it across the part…….twice. TMs were able to straighten it all out and ELs touched it all up. Ran 5 parts without issue. Found metal shavings on the sensor. Once we cleaned it up the sensor started working as expected. Keep an eye on it. This had TMs and myself tied up until 5:15am so no other follow up has been completed.
 ","#1 main.  On two occasions we had issues on cross belts CB01 and CB03 went into creep speed.  This in turn caused the pallets to skew between CB3 and CB4.  While looking thru the logic to determine why the belts were going into creep speed, a logic edit was found testing in that section of logic.  I asked Livers to untest the edit and he did but unfortunately he also deleted it so we were not able to determine what the edit did.  Earlier Bert Collins found prox switch 5PRS4A laying on the floor.  He installed it back on lift table #5.  It is the decel switch for lift table #5 when a pallet exits the mezz level elevator, so the edit could have something to do with it.  Issue happened both times when the pallet farm was full.  No issues afterward, and we did fill the farm back up later in the night.    ",,,,"Chain wadded up on the new Tutwiler/ White sta 90 conveyor.

LH Framing pre-clamp adhesive inspection camera isn’t working quite right. Image wont focus and keeps cutting out. Also will not allow you to pan and zoom. I messed with it for a while but couldn’t figure it out. Maybe one of the controls gods or the supplier can help us out? This adhesive inspection station is pretty crucial!
 
Wayne Ginsimore went out of his way to study cycle times for the door line cells and identify areas where we had potential to improve. He has begun studying robot paths and adjusting partials on Henrob guns where we have the clearance. This has potential to improve door line cycle time by seconds. He was recognized for his efforts.
 
LHBS – Cell was left in quite a confusing state. Robot 7K-40-L08 that had FDS feed tubes replaced was brought down to a position which caused DCS zone lock. There was no gun on the tool and bits had been turned on to get it to where it was. There were spray botes left on robots and a total of 7 safety gates open. Took a while to figure out what was going on and get everything ready to run. I know it’s part of line bump but the robot being left like that had us rather confused. Brad Wagner was able to get it all taken care of.

If any 3 of these robots cause the part to be suspect they will be routed to the appropriate POC for swap just like they did before since they do spots which get closed out.  All other suspect parts from 7K will come out to be swapped at S010CV1 of 7X marriage.  PCB will show SUS in yellow when suspect part is passing through but will show SUS in red when the part is stopped waiting to be pulled out. HMI suspect part screens have been modified to match the new process.  This suspect routing change was done to prevent loss of time from swaps on the back side of the line while the bodyside inner conveyor lost float.  Swapping at 7X-10 allows bodyside inner to continue to run while the part is being swapped.  We tested this process today without issue but if any trouble arises you can toggle TempStd.Bool05
 
 As a result of a visit from McNaughton-McKay about our Dynics crash issues it was found that the VirtualBackplane was causing numerous errors in the system log and was set to automatically turn on at CRW system boot.

VirtualBackplane startup registry file was changed from 1 to 4 to disable the PC from trying to load the driver at boot.  TechNote attached.

6Y-80-10 – FDS faults – 3x for 56min – Had one lengthy downtime before I got here. Shory after I started we had an occurrence where the linear slide bearings were seized up. Aligned it all and still were having trouble getting the gun to retract. Also found hold down pressure backed off. Increased pressure and gun advanced/retracted more smoothly. We did not have any units coming to us from framer during this downtime so we opted to keep working on the gun rather than abort program and try to swap it in the middle of a unit.
 
6X-20-04 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 18min – Rivet not trapped reset for a multiple rivet fault. TMs called to clear rivets. They also cleaned the gun removing built up adhesive. This was the first occurrence of this I have seen. If it happens again we need to look at the transition of the dynamic feed tube to the head of the feedstick.
 
8A-110-01 – Tape getting jammed – Had TMs adjust tape cut blade and chuting. Also adjusted the tape exit tube for a smooth transition. Increased tape cut pressure slighy and set it to auto-cut every 8 rivets. Should be good now.
 
8A-140-01 Gun #2 – Tape not cutting – Was informed tape was not cutting. Did not cut when manually fired from HMI. Found tape cut valve communication cable unplugged. Plugged back in. (Set-up)
 
8A-100-02 – Tape pull retry – Informed by operator they are dying on cycle time because the robot is retrying each rivet. Found all partials set to 30 (low as you can go) also found sprocket pressure could be increased slighy. Turned sprocket pressure up about 5psi to assist it in pulling low spools. Also set the partials from 30mm to 100mm. Should still be well within cycle time over there.

#1 – 8Y-20-02 – Feed fault – 1x for 34min – Tape began getting chewed up. EL tried feeding new tape in and resetting but kept faulting. Called TMs and PF over to check out/change GBSD. Went ahead and changed it. With GBSD off we found the punch to be loose. Installed new GBSD/nose and tightened punch. When we went to run again it feed faulted again. Tape looked the same. EL fed new tape in and sent it back. Feed fault again. Instructed the EL to feed fresh tape from the nose all the way to the tape cutter to ensure we were binding behind the sprocket gate. Once we fed the fresh tape it took off and ran without issue.
 
#3 – 6X-20-13 – Feed fault – 10x for 24min – EL kept it limping through the shift. Swapped GBSD and nose at end of shift and validated with about 10 units. Good to go.
 
#8 – 6X-180-05 – Head too low – 1x for 13min – Nose insert fell out of nose causing rivmon fault. TMs came and changed the nose.
 
#9 – 6X-20-01 – Rivet not trapped/multiple rivets – 1x for 11min – EL reset fault for multiple rivets. TMs came and cleared rivets from feedstick. Did not repeat.
 
6Y-80-10 – Head binding up again. TMs came and aligned it up and cleaned all the adhesive from the head and bit.
 
#7 – 8A-140-01 – Feed fault low rivets – 1x for 20min – Tool ran out of rivets. Had to go fetch Joe Jackey from the crib to change the spool. He said the rivet spool status was not accurate I told him to fix it.
 
#9 – 8F-130-03 – Head too low – 1x for 19min – Nose fell off tool. Picked it off the floor and noticed it was bent and had a mark like it had been hit. Brian Lindley informed me this has happened before. TMs changed GBSD and nose. We watched the tool run through its path and did not see anywhere where it was hitting but there were quite a few spots that were very close. If a part wasn’t sitting down perfecy I could definitely see it hitting. Partials were set to 30. We opened them up to 80. Will continue to monitor.

7K-20-L06 Gun #1 – G1.6 Black setter failure – 1x for 1hr – Setter began getting “absolute position invalid” faults. Which then led to “excessive deviation” faults and the tool not homing. Without seeing the head back (tool home) the robot would not come out to maintenance using FFR. EL had to go in the cell and carefully teach the robot out so it would not crash. Once we got it out to maintenance positon we found the setter was completely seized up. The position it was locked up in would not allow us access to the bolt to remove the GBSD so we could change the setter. TMs had to fetch a large pipe wrench and turn the flywheel with that in order to remove the GBSD. Once we got the GBSD off the swap went as expected and was back running. The setter that failed only had 150k cycles on it and was running at 68kN. It has been tagged and placed in the FRACAS cage and email has been sent to Henrob and VO team about these “new and improved” black setters failing pre-maturely under normal operating conditions.
 
6X-40-03 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 15min – Heard a loud bang and got nose switch faults. Pulled out and found punch stuck in nose. Ended up finding punch was broken. Took a minute to fish the fragments out of the setter but once it was all removed we replaced the punch and the tool was sent back in to production.
 
7K-20-L06 Gun #1 – Encoder issues – On one of the last parts ran of the night we began getting double rivet faults on our new setter and the tool speed was dipping by 80mm/s causing the rivets to only be half inserted into the part. When we looked at the home offset it was off and the tool position was unknown. We were able to home it but to a poor value of 4.5mm. Brought it out and continued to re-home it. Each time getting an unsatisfactory value. TMs took motor cover off and we noted it was aligned correcy but they turned it about 10 degrees because they said the 250 series sometimes needs to be turned a bit to home properly on the test stand. Once we turned the motor the home offset was good at 5.002mm. Send it back in and the setter riveted but locked up on the part with an “encoder error” fault. We were able to bring the tool home and take it to maintenance. Swapped the encoder cable from the setter to wrist of robot. Home offset was no good again at 4.6mm. We were out of room to run so we went ahead and swapped the EC6T module on gun #1. Once we swapped that the tool homed out good at 5.002mm. Need to monitor at start up to make sure it is resolved.
 
7G-70-R01 – Was under impression it was gun #1 Dave had issues with tonight. Went over to check it out and it was on gun #1 and running well so I let it be. Now at 5:10am reading the shift note I see it was gun #2 they couldn’t do an offset with. Ill get it tonight.

#2 – 8Y-10-06 – 14x for 36min – Had quite a few min depth not reached faults on step 15 on various spots. Adjusted step 13 pressure and step 15 torque with lite success. Also quite a few faults were due to a worn out bit. Once bit was changed it got slighy better.
 
#10 – 6Y-150-02 – Feed fault – 2x for 7min – Tape dragging when fed through nose. Punch seemed to be sticking as well. Between shifts TMs swapped GBSD and nose.
 
8A-110 – Support bracket arm for nut chuting has been removed. This caused us quite a bit of faults because the chuting began to sag causing the nuts to misfeed and the feeder to time-out. Night shift TMs spent quite a bit of time repairing the broken arm last week and getting it all back together. Not sure why it was removed but it doesn’t help the press run and is going to cause damage to the chuting and possibly the press due to nut misfeed/alignment.
 
After we were done running I was informed paint was complaining about adhesive squeeze out on windshield, rocker and liftgate opening.

RH bodyside outer conveyor carrier #3 b-pillar wipers were found to be too tight.

We never were able to send bowl out for error proofing and MTS never got back to me on any alternative solutions. Will need to follow up on that to prevent this from happening again.
 
7X-30-R02 – Feed fault – 8x for 5min – EL called and said tool wouldn’t feed rivet into nose. Got with TMs and PFs and went ahead and changed GBSD since we were backed up to paint. This new GBSD only made it a few minutes and then started giving nose switch faults. The nose switch itself seemed to be sticking quite badly. We then put another GBSD on and it ran. I was later told the GBSD that was put on before hadn’t be rebuilt and we were out of 137s so they just grabbed it hoping it was one we just swapped and it would run. Not the case.
 
7K-20-R03 – Nose switch fault – 7x for 5min – Intermittent nose switch faults through the shift. Ran it until end of shift and then swapped the GBSD. It had roughly 240k cycles on it.
 
#3 CM – Was told at the end of the night they were still having issues with the adhesive not sticking to the part due to oil. Not sure why production didn’t hand this info off but night-shift  knew dayshift was wiping parts but didn’t do it because she wasn’t told to. We had to take a rack of CMs to repair. Need to continue to wipe as long as the excessive oil/moisture is present. We tried it on a dozen or so parts and the issue immediately went away.

We have worked with VO and gotten no help. We cross sectioned units and identified the rivet was collapsing. Tonight rear ladder exploded with rivmon faults. Easily over 50 occurrences and 2hrs of downtime resulting in bad rivets that required repair. The rivets were out of spec and sitting high so we kept continuously adjusting velocity trying to get them within spec with lite-to-no success. Dave had changed the spool twice, the setter and went through the punch and die. After so long I had Brian Lindley grab a rivet spool with a different batch code on it than the one curreny running and faulting. As soon as we put the new spool on the rivets were buried deep due to the velocity changes we made. We backed everything off and checked the next 10 parts. Everything remained consistent and we had zero faults. It was then I noticed QE rivets are only used on 4 tools in the shop. 2 on rear ladder and 2 in framing seg. 2…all of which have had the same issues. I was able to find the bin of spools from batch 74322. There were 7 spools missing from the bin and I was able to track them all down and get them off the line. They have been set aside at P25 for Jeff Epps to check out. Rear ladder has a few spools from a different batch on the line but framing does not have any…I did not see any more bins of spools so I am assuming that is all we have. Will need to expedite good certified material in to supply the shop.
 
8F-130-01 – Clinch placement not advanced – 23x for 57min – Switch was reading 337mm just outside of the 336mm tolerance. Lindley adjusted the tolerance on the switch to accommodate this 1mm difference since it was lined up and firing fine. May need further logic adjustments to give it time to be made. Monitor.
 
8F-130-01 – Escarpment not extended – 47x for 50min – Nut feeder escapement binding up. TMs went through and PM’d the feeder between shifts. Monitor.
 
7G-10-L03 – Pusher not retracted – 5x for 30min – After the setter swap from afternoon shift we couldn’t run due to pusher not retracted faults. Checked punch and everything out and it was good. Swapped stud feed head and still getting faults. Noticed the pusher prox was not getting power. Found connection loose near I/O block. Once that was tightened it ran the rest of the shift.",,,,,"Installed plastic covering over buss duct at CC30/29 in the mezz to shield it from water leaking from the roof.

#3 – 6Y-110-03 – Feed fault – 2x for 26min – Started with feed faults. EL tried to keep it going but couldn’t. TM and PF were called to change GBSD. Changed out and still had issue on very first rivet. Tape was over pulling so much it was nearly puching two rivets. Checked for loose punch. Not loose. Before I got there TMs changed punch anyway. Still faulting with same tape feed issue. Noticed sprocket pressure was at 55psi on a tiny 3mm tool. Dropped down to about 45psi and issue went away completely. Not sure if EL tried increasing that on his own at first but I don’t see how it was ever running that high.
 
#4 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 6x for 18min – Only faulted 1 time while I was here. Didn’t do anything with it. Plan is to do reach studies Sunday with McClure to see if we can stabilize the rear pan. If that doesn’t work we will look into adding arms lagged to the floor to stabilize the rear pan area. To be continued…..
 
7K-40-L02 – Ran gun #1 all night. At end of production switched to gun #2 and touched up the 2 spots that were faulting for step 15 strip outs (spot 9 and 15). Ran 5 parts without issue. Monitor.
 
8E-240-02 – Had some issues with the front ladder joint 2128. Joint has low interlock. Cross sections have been performed and VO is investigating new rivet and die combo. For the time being I did some studies and ended up making the decision to add 2 manufacturing rivets on the ladder. One on each side for joint 2128. Took some finesse in the tight geo fixture but we were able to get everything to fit and reach. Added the rivets and stepped it through. Ran 3 parts in auto with no issue. The spots are labeled “Mitch 1” and “Mitch 2” in robot program and are spots 31 and 32 in the Henrob controller. Until we get a new rivet die combo I believe these rivets will greay help stabilize this joint and fix the issue we are seeing.

7K-40-L02 – back on gun #2.
 
6X-60-01 – Primary tube has been cleared of all jammed screws and we successfully fed screws through it. Still have back-up tube hooked up to get some use of it. Will start writing some work orders to change the Weber feed tubes throughout the shop.
 
6X-80-03 – Checked in on what could be causing all the dies breaking. Walked up to the tool and pulled the die out with my fingers. Was told pokeyoke was installed and good. It was not. Poke yoke was not secured in and was slid all the way down to the base of the c-frame not even contacting the die. Once we removed it we found it was broken as well. The pokeyoke not being installed correcy was causing the set screw to put side load on the stem of the die which then caused the side load on the die itself causing it to break. New pokeyoke has been installed and secured with the Loctite 648 retaining compound.
 
8Y-10-05/06 – Did reach studies on riveting robots in the station to see if we could use them as support when screwing. DCS with the light screens does not allow us to reach an area on the UB that will help our situation. If we want to stabilize the UB we will need to figure out some sort of mechanical pushers mounted to the floor or roll bed.
 
6Y-80-04 – Upon start up the gun would not run. Went and found the HMI was in some sort of safe boot mode. Plugged in a mouse and keyboard and tried to get out of it with no success. Purchased new HMI from stores. Removed old SSD and put it in new HMI and hooked it up. Still seeing the same screen. Put the new SSD in the new HMI. This allowed us to boot up like normal. However we lost all data. Reloaded it all from the CRW using a backup from 2-16-19. We were able to get everything back and it is running fine now.",,,,,"Cleaned all Tox air filters

 ","Shimmed the locks on C02 VL#9 and raised the set point for raised.    We could not verify transition of the pallet from elevator to PRB 14.    Set the elevation using a level.    The locks were shimmed by welding flat stock to the face of the lock.   Theyused a 12 ft ladder from inside the elevator with the elevator raised and pinned out.    The original set point for raised position was 23970.    Please run Framer 1 and cycle VL #9 to verify the transition from VL #9 to PRB 14 in the mezz.   -----Cycled units and the elevator was a bit high.  Changed setpoint from 23990 to 23980 and indexed the elevator to make sure the locks would still engage.  Monitor at startup.
 
According the PF's we need another pallet of 410A drums added to the delivery for this shop.  They said the delivery has gone from 3 to 2 pallets recently and it's cutting it too close for comfort.

Cleaned shop some, this needs to be followed up on all shifts until it's presentable. Dan will review again. 
 
Rebuilt a setter. 
 
Faults: 
8Y10-6: Max time exceeded faults step 14 on programs 20 and 26. x5. Gun was swapped while I was interviewing. 
 
6Y80-10: Max depth gradient and min depth faults x 10, this needs some attention at the end of the shift. EL's are keeping up with the line rate for now.

6X20-R2: Head too low faults x 2. No changes made, monitor. 
 
Nights – Snyder
#3 – 8X-40-03 – Double rivet – 2x for 23min – Faulted once around 10pm but not again until a lite after 11. At 11 it faults on 2 spots on one unit. The sister tool on the other side of the UB faulted as well with the same fault. Rivets were sitting very high. Inspected part but in the fixture with the gun in there couldn’t see much. Sent unit as suspect and watched it run a few more without any issue. Chalking it up to some sort of part issue but not really sure what. Inspectors had rivets repaired and sent it on its way. Will keep an eye on it.
 
#9 – 8Y-90-02 – Head too low – Velocity changes on dayshift not taught creeping in as head too low faults. Checked rivets and adjusted end distance nominal.
 
#10 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 6x for 17min – Some max torque followed by max time faults. Generally indicates stripped bit. Swapped to gun #1 to run. This tool is the Snoop Dogg of smoking bits...sure enough bit was toasted. Swapped bit and cleaned up between shifts. Back on gun #2.
 
7X-30-L01 – Head too low – 5x for 3min – Faulting on numerous models and numerous spots. End distance was trending high on pretty much every schedule. Inspectors checked rivets and verified they were good. Adjusted nominal on almost all schedules.
 
7G-70-L01 – FDS – 2x for 21min – Gun was hanging up. TMs came and swapped head because it was gummed up and aligned linear bearings.
 
8Y-110-02 – Head too low – Spot 33 nominal adjusted. Running good for now.
 
Continued GBSD/nose rebuilds following this weekend’s swappananza.
 
Spoke with #1 shift TMs about carts waiting up front in the morning. After a lite therapy they seemed to understand.
 
Also touched on TM shop cleanliness. Finger pointing began. Need to get to a good starting point and audit each shift to find out where the mess is coming from.
 
Setter swap alert signs were put in folders and given to TMs.. they will be securing them to the boxes/carts.

#2 – 6X-180-04 – Feed fault – 1x for 25min – Broken punch. TMs swapped punch, GBSD and nose. Took a lite finesse to get the punch fragments out.
 
7G-50-L01 – Min depth not reached – 2x for 25min – A lite bit of manual intervention led to multiple screws being jammed in the head. TMs had to disassemble to get them all out and get it back running.
 
Discussed importance of checking UB being seated on pins after check with all night-shift inspectors. I believe we could use the scrap unit as our teardown for this month. We are scheduled to do a 554 LWB but the scrap unit is a 553 LWB. Really shouldn’t be a difference. If anyone opposes we don’t have to use it but just trying to reduce scrap cost.

7X-20-R01 – Head too low – 4x for 10min – Nose got ripped out of tool somehow. Was direcy after spool change so I’m wondering if tape was yanked in and rivet was pushed sideways down nose causing it to break. Replaced nose and checked punch out.

Still faulting. Went to swap punch assembly but could not find one to fit and there was no part number on the one on the tool and the lineside paperwork didn’t seem to show one. Still failing. Took head apart and replaced the o-ring inside. Still failing. Replaced die. Still failing. Clinches were good so we temporarily reduced the toolcheck min in order for production to run. Inspectors were inspecting more frequeny. Not really sure what is going on here. Seemed it has been happening. TOX said they were coming in today for some reason so I am directing them to this first.
 
Was called to front door line because they were getting sliver type dents along the upper window flange hem of LH Lincoln. Went in and checked the hem dies and they were indeed pretty dirty. Cleaned all the dies and rollers along with the wipers on the robot. Metal guy claims dents are still there and its coming from having too much adhesive in the hem. Door teardown looks great so I do not see a need to change anything from a hem adhesive standpoint. I highly doubt adhesive in the hem would cause dents on the outside surface of the door. We shory switched to RH Lincolns and those looked okay he said. I think the door skins coming in had the defects and it was just more apparent when they wiped them all down as they unloaded. Monitor.

7B10-1W: B pillar inner HH31 nut feeder not pushing nuts all the way out. Found nuts jammed halfway out with smaller nuts mixed in. Cleaned the hopper and sorter out finding 20+ small nuts mixed in. 
 
8Y10-5: Gun 1 Swapped bit and head, touched up LWB and SWB
 
Faults: 
8Y110-3: Feed faults, Swapped GBSD, continued to fault. Found cable to be bad and swapped it. 
 
6X40-6: Head too high x2. Nothing changed, this seems to happen at start up most every day. 
 
 
Nights – Snyder
Out of parts most the night so it was rather slow.
 
7G-70-L01 Gun #1 – 9x for 1hr53min – Faulting pretty consisteny on the first spot of the respot sequence. At one point fault was latched while we struggled through shift registers and robots being out of sequence. Also noticed when FFR was used for this it did not tag the part suspect so we had quite a few parts missing screws get taken straight past the pulloff and loaded into rack. Manually tagged a few as suspect so they could get repaired. Needs follow up. Swapped to gun #2 to finish the shift. Will touch up gun #1 Sunday night when French is here.
 
Weekend work plan for both shifts created.

Tracked down a mouse to get it back on but then failed toolcheck due to a broken die. TMs replaced die and we were able to run. Touchscreen still does not function. TOX was in the plant and came over. They seem to think there is a warranty issue with the Siemens drivers in the HMIs themselves. Will be following up on that and purchasing another HMI in the mean time.
 
6Y-180-01 - Step 4 min depth/strip outs - A lot of faults due to step 4. Screw is hanging up in the head. On the retry and eject it runs fine. Also stripping out on some spots.

6X-20-03 – Mag was swapped this weekend and not filled. Went into job and faulted. Had to abort and auto dock.
 
8Y-10-05 – Programs touched up. Back on gun #1.
 
8F-120-03 – Nose switch fault – GBSD swapped this weekend. Faulted on first rivet. Nose switch stuck on. Swapped with another 138 GBSD. Same thing. Swapped another GBSD. Same thing. All had green tags and were noted as tested. They didn’t pass on the bench. Found one with a split in the nose switch cable at the nose and the other two were way off adjustment on the nose switch. TMs had to rebuild one to install. Running now.
 
6Y-140-04 – Nose switch fault – GBSD was gummed up with adhesive and punch was loose. Tightened punch and swapped GBSD. Good to go.
 
TMs worked on date stamps, hemmers and PMs.
 
TMs working on inventory of GBSDs based on shop usage. Putting together an order to stock us up better on ones we run low on.
 
6Y-80-10 – Brake not RET – Gun was acting pretty strange. Whenever it fired a screw or went to eject the holding air valve seemed to stick on. Sometimes it would go off and sometimes it would stay on. I believe when it was staying on it was drawing too much air to cycle the brake (they are on the same valve). Went to swap manifold but couldn’t find one in stores. Ordered what I thought was one close enough with the intention on swapping just one of the valves and found they weren’t the same so we swapped to gun #2 to start up. When we swapped gun acted weird when trying to decouple so I had the ELs clean contacts on gun #1 ATI module. Will need follow up or can be left for me tonight to work on. I am afraid we do not have the actual gun manifold set up in stores because it was assumed we used the same as 558. Ours is different so I am having a hard time finding it. I have reached out to FESTO for help in identifying our manifold along with pricing for us to get it ordered ASAP.

#4 – 6X-140-02 – Feed fault – 2x for 25min – EL tried to keep it going but it continued to fault. Got tied up on another fault so it sat for a bit. TMs and PFs were eventually called to swap out GBSD. No more faults after that.
 
#6 – 7K-20-L01 – FDS – 12x for 22min – Blew bit and jaws out. EL didn’t realize and kept resetting. Eventually swapped gun to get through shift. Between shift TMs replaced head and bit. Back on gun #1.
 
6Y-80-10 – Valve manifold has been swapped and gun #1 is back on. Monitor at start up. If issue continues it is electrical. Either toolside ATI or the power cable going to manifold is my guess.

#1 – 6X-60-01 – FDS – 5x for 1hr25min – Fault happened at end of production and didn’t actually cause us to lose any units. However we dug into the gun and found the belt was broken which was why it wouldn’t run. Picked the gun out of the cell and took it back to shop to be rebuilt. Did NOT have any LH drive guns to spare in the shop (had 3 RH drive). Should be able to get belt replaced today and get gun back in cell. As of now there isn’t a back-up but gun #2 is running well.

#6 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 6x for 12min – Still on gun #2. Did not get around to this one tonight. Tied up at framing respot between shifts. Still needs follow up.
 
#7 – 6Y-180-01 – FDS – Was on gun #2. Swapped back to gun #1 and put tool on its side and manually fed screws. Could easily see the screw was getting cocked sideways and hung up at the jaw which was causing the step 4 faults. Jaws were tight. Opened jaws up and then manually fed about 20 more screws through without issue. Still on gun #1. Monitor at start up.
 
6Y-180-01 – Hopper vibrator frequency is turned up to 70 I am being told. This is not normal and should not be this high to feed screws. Will dig into it tonight. Motor could be going back or something could be loose causing the vibrations to dissipate.
 
9B-250-02 – Toolcheck NOK – 4x for 25min – Broken SKB die. Once I am done with framer seg 2 conversion I am going to see what we can do to convert these as well if possible.
 
Need to pass information to all rivet runners that they should not overfill the hoppers. It causes downtime each and every time they do it. Too many screws blocks the sorting device from feeding screws to the rail going to the escapement. There is a sticker in there telling them where to fill to. I talked to night shift production about it.

 Nights – Snyder
8Y-10-05 – Still on gun #2. Backed up full. I am thinking there are a few programs where the tool is taught too close now allowing us to get the depth target in step 7. Had McClure lined up to bring tool back in Z on a few spots but he was stuck on CAL line most the end of the night and didn’t get to it. Will do it Sunday night or can be tried today.
 
6Y-80-10 – Brake not ret faults on gun #1. Swapped to gun #2. Gun #2 had issues running. Program 1 getting step 7 min depth not reached faults. Barely out. Adjusted step 7 depth tolerances. Between shifts had toolmakers take gun #1 brake apart and clean it up. Cycled it manually numerous times to ensure it was functioning. Back on gun #1. Monitor.
 
7K-20-R01 – Didn’t work on it. Still on gun #2.
 
6Y-180-01 – Didn’t work on it. Still on gun #2.
 
6X-20-04 – 1MC setter swap complete. Installed black 250102 setter. Did not fault. Inspectors will get first suspect rotation 3001. Went to update new setter tracker matrix but it was locked out. Needs to be updated still.
 
6Y-80-10 – Due to some FDS issue rotation 2979 is missing a whole bunch of screws and will need repaired at T23.
 
7K-30-L01 Gun #1 – Gun was stepped through both long and short program. EL said he didn’t find anything wrong but did think it was close to the b-pillar so he moved it slighy. I then found it was in no rivet when stepped through so there was no way to see where the nose was rubbing without it moving. We then were out of room to run so we couldn’t do it again. Probably needs to be stepped through again.
 
#5 – 8Y-10-03 – Head too low – 8x for 16min – Faulting on spot 4. Looks like there were some big spikes in the end distance. No adjustments made. Tired capturing a faulted unit to check out the metal but did not have any faults while I was here. Monitor.
 
#6 – 8X-40-01 – Head too low – 1x for 14min – Damaged underbody caused fault.
 
#8 – 6X-140-02 – Feed fault – 1x for 12min – Chewing tape up pretty bad. Checked sprocket pressure which was good. Swapped GBSD and issues went away.
 
#10 – 6X-60-01 – Intermittent internal torque faults – Was swapped to gun #2 by afternoons. At lunch we went in and changed transducer on gun #1. Suspect it was damaged from trying to run the gun with a broken belt. New transducer ran all night without any faults. Will need to send old one out for repair.
 
8Y-80-02 – Head too low – 4x for 9min – Faulting on spots 8 and 9. Spikes in end distance. Did not adjust. Monitor.
 
8Y-90-03 – Head too low – 6x for 7min – Spikes in end distance. Rivet area is along same flange that was damaged in UB main line so I am thinking we had more than one unit with damaged flange come through. Monitor/check faulted unit.
 
7K-20-L06 – Head too low – 3x for 4min – Faulting on spot 1 and 5. End distance trending high. Adjusted.
 
6X-20-04 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 9min – Reset for multiple rivets. TMs came and cleared. Did not repeat.
 
6X-100-04 – Head too low/Speed too low – Velocity was adjusted yesterday around 8am and not taught. Verified rivets were good and taught rivmon on spots 33 and 93.
 
7G-20-R01 – No more issues out of nut press is what I was told. FIS shows the same.
 
 
 
 ","Damaged two units in underbody station 30.  Repaired one, scraped one.  E stop was depressed in sta 5 while the sta 30 robots were sealing.  Once reset the robots completed their seal cycle and came out to maintenance position for acceptance.  Once accepted, the unit transferred out and another unit transferred in, and two sealer robots struck the transferring units.  The maintenance positions for the sta 30 sealer robots were recently adjusted to a lower position to allow the pipefitters better access to the sealer components.  Electrician said he did not realize the units would transfer while the robot was into and out maintenance position.  
 
Replaced the cord and splitter for CW decel switch on turn table C04TT18 at the beginning of famer 2.  We had several faults on the table again.

#1 – 6X-20-04 – Rivet not escaped – 1x for 8.5hrs – Not a real fault. Last fault was at 1:30pm. Was latched in FIS for duration of shift.
 
#2 – 6Y-80-01 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 6x for 50min – Not sure where downtime came from. ELs were keeping it going with a simple FFR. Ended up adjusting step 7 depth target on program 5 from -18.5mm to -18mm. This took care of faults for rest of shift.
 
#3 – 8Y-10-03 – Head too low – 12x for 21min – Last fault was around 8pm. Inspectors said the rivets were good but end distance was spiking. The inspectors also inspected the units and didn’t see anything wrong with the metal. I told EL to hold next job that faults so I can check it out in station.
 
#5 – 8X-80-01 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 14min – Nose switch stuck on. EL tried to keep it going but switch wouldn’t turn off. TMs and PF swapped GBSD. No more issues.
 
#9 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 5x for 10min – Faulting here and there on gun #2. Still on gun #2. At end of shift we took backups of 8Y-10-06 and 8Y-10-05. Tomorrow we are going to install screw programs from 10-06 onto 10-05 to see if we can get gun #1 back going. Didn’t have units to verify tonight.
 
6X-160-03 – Setter swap – EL informed me they were fighting rivmon faults all afternoon. Kept adjusting end distance just for it to trend outside of tolerance again. Rivets were good. Checked home offset and found it had drifted to 4.5mm. Re-homed and it homed at 5.001mm so we tried running it again. This began to fault because of previous adjustments. Taught rivmon. Once it was out of teach 100 it started faulting again. Found home offset at 4.2mm. Tool is a 73kN tool so I assume shear pin was toasted. Installed a new black setter at lunch. Rivets were deep with black setter so backed velocity off 20mm/s on all spots and taught rivmon. If tool faults today its most likely because that unit was captured in teach 100. Blue setter only had 97k cycles on it but since the tool is such high force we won’t get anywhere with FRACAS.
 
#2/#3 – 7B-110-14 – Clinch fault – Right at beginning of shift tool was failing toolcheck. TMs replaced punch and die. No better. Replaced head assembly and it took care of toolcheck issue but then we broke 2 fittings off due to PF installing them in wrong location. Once they got that figured out tool ran fine.
 
#7 – 9A-40-02 – FDS – 8x for 32min – No calls for downtime. See faults in FIS. Meant to follow up on this one but forgot. Will check before I leave and work on it tonight if it’s still giving trouble. Just keep it on radar because I know there is some back and forth going on with production over there.

Temporarily ran a cable on the outside of the Leoni before turning it back over to production.  Pulled the cable inside the Leoni after production was done.  Production time lost was minimal due to production staffing shortage so 7G was running block build.
 
Front door TT50 operator DC gun failed late in the shift Friday night.  Got a brand new gun from the satellite crib but that one was DOA.  Wouldn't connect to the controller.

Front door wasn't able to strip out because of this breakdown but that was largely due to not being notified there was a problem for over an hour.

At 1:00 pm on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 security received a call from SUV Body Team Manager Loren Petter requesting an incident report for damage to electric conduit at P-15.  Fire Officer Cathy Mathews responded.  An unknown forklift driver had apparently struck a section of conduit under the mezzanine at P-15. The electric wire was severed and hanging from the mezzanine (see pictures).  The damage was discovered by MP&L Process Coach Hope Doedyns who then contacted manager Petter.  Ford electricians were contacted to repair the damage.  It is unknown who was responsible for the damage.  END OF REPORT.

While watching it I saw it fail as I would expect if a part wasn't in the rack correctly but the parts were good.  I watched the Robeye while it was running and noticed the match score and the offsets were below target values.  I don't know what has changed but we may need to fine tune the Robeye setup.  Just in case it actually is a cable issue we moved the temporary cable that was running from the camera to jt3 on down the line running from jt3 to the robot pedestal.  I'm unsure if the x-code cable connectors are just cable unions or if they serve as some kind of filer or amplifier.  Sent and email to Bradley Vargo at Recognition Robotics to find out.

#2 – 6X-180-01 – Head too high – 3x for 24min – Faulted on spots 154, 155 and 215. One of the faults was while we were working on 6X-60 so it sat for a bit because we didn’t notice. Adjusted nominal and also noticed end distance tolerances were opened up. Set them back to +/-0.30mm.
 
#3 – 6X-60-04 – Head back not on – 2x for 22min – Gun locked up on job and wouldn’t do anything. Just kept timing out and then throwing head not back. Went in and verified the head was back and brought it to the gate. Told it to eject and it started acting very weird. Instead of ejecting the gun extended like it was going to screw. Sent it back in on next job and got step 2 max time exceeded faults because the signal was sent to screw and then gun didn’t move. Brought it back out and swapped to gun #1 to finish the shift. No issues out of gun #1. Between shifts installed both signal and servo jumpers from gun to robot side ATI bypassing tool side ATI on gun #2. Ran 1 job fine. Pulled the servo jumper off and ran 2 more jobs without issue. Went ahead and installed a new EN21T module on gun #2. It is still on gun #2 and ready to go for the morning. Monitor.
 
#5 – 6X-20-17 – Head too low – 5x for 15min – Did not fault after the afternoon shift adjustments.
 
8Y-10-06 – Still on gun #1. I did not get over there to work on it. Worked on 60-04 most the time between shifts. Needs follow up still.
 
6Y-150-02 – Head too low – 3x for 12min – Spots 2, 3 and 4 spiked a couple of times. Adjusted nominal slighy.
 
6X-160-04 – Head too high – 3x for 8min – Spots 91, 31 and 24 faulted. Spikes were pretty far out. Left alone. Monitor.
 
6Y-110-05 – Head too high – 2x for 2min – Spot 156. Spikes were pretty far off. Robot rivets on rocker. We have been known to get some short DOP on the rocker area causing us some faults.
 
8E-240-02 – Material too hard – 7x for 14min – Spot 31 manufacturing rivet we added a while ago was causing some problems with force readings. Fault mapping wasn’t set up for that spot like the rest. Went ahead and made it match the rest and did not have any more issues.
 
6X-40-06 – Head too low – 2x for 10min – Faulted on 1 job almost every spot and end distance was spiking. Brought out to the gate and the die was almost falling out. I don’t think that was the issue but we happened to notice it so the TMs came and tightened it up.
 
TMs worked on the past due PMs.

Next we changed the two ATI modules on the robot side EN30-M and EN31M.  Swapped to Gun # 1, Gun  #1 did the offset.  We swapped back to Gun # 2 and it also did an offset.

#2 – 6Y-80-10 – FDS – 8x for 28min – Only one fault after afternoon shift adjustments. Monitor.
 
#3 – 6Y-180-02 – Max time exceeded – 3x for 27min – Destroyed 3 bits while I was here. Last time the jaws were pretty beat up as well. Replaced bit again along with the entire head assembly. Appears program needs to be gone through on the inside blind clearance holes as well as the top of the HFE. Elkins said he doesn’t have the template so we swapped the gun. Needs to be touched up by Marty or Paul. Gun is on gun #1 until then…2 will run but will be chewing up bits left and right.
 
#4 – 6X-170-02 – Head too low – 2x for 26min – Tool began faulting every spot. End distance was off by over 2mm. Home offset had drifted slighy but not too much. Rivets were a lite deep but not 2mm deep. Checked die and punch. Tried to re-home tool and then got stuck with Abs. Position Invalid faults and we couldn’t get it to home again. Setter was at 977,653 cycles and running at 71kN. Wanted to put a black setter on but it does not clear. Setter motor cover will get crushed by the arm of the robot while riveting. Blue setter installed and tool is running again. Rotation 0100 is the first rotation with new setter. Should be checked out by inspectors.
 
#10 – 6Y-180-04 – Tool release safety switch not made – When we went to swap 180-02…EL accideny hit 180-04. It went to drop off gun #2 but would not make release switch because the arm was broken off the AB limit switch. Not sure how long it has been like that. Checked all over the floor of the cell to find the arm but had no luck. Ended up finding one stashed in the cabinet by PTS. New arm put on and tool was swapped back over.
 
8Y-10-05 – Still on gun #1. Tim said it only faulted a few times. Everything blew up at about 3:30am in framing respot so I didn’t get a chance to switch it and let it run. Still needs follow up.
 
6X-60-04 – FDS – 3x for 6min – At lunch we swapped the servo cable ATI module (only thing we haven’t done yet). We put gun #2 back on and tried to run. Still seeing the weird head not back faults and the gun acting strange. I could swear this is a signaling issue but it doesn’t follow to gun #1 and we have changed all the toolside ATI stuff. I suppose need to line up a RH spindle gun in the shop and pull this one out of the cell. Although I really don’t know what is wrong with it. Will see if Joiner can come put his eyes on it and see if he sees anything.
 
#1 – 7G-20-L01 – Feeder escapement – 4x for 40min – First call escapement was binding up. Tool kept running even though it wasn’t sending a nut. Eventually running the chute empty and causing the escapement to time out when trying to send nuts. TMs cleaned up escapement and put it back together. We then began the 10min+ process of refilling the chuting to get it to run. It lasted a lite bit and then did the same thing. TMs came back and took apart escapement again. This time they stoned it and lubricated the plunger that pushes the escapement. They also cleaned up some burrs on the chuting going into the escapement. Again…had to refill the chuting which too some time. Ran the rest of the shift. Monitor.

#4 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS max time faults (program time out) – 11x for 16min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Gun #1 didn’t fault at all. Looking at the fault logs there was faults all over there place on a bunch of programs. The program time out in step 11 and 14 are kind of concerning. Not sure whats cuasing this. If it was torque or depth it would tell us. But seems it wants the gun to do something and doesn’t see it. Will swap tonight and work on it while we run if production allows. Still on gun #2.
 
#9 – 6X-20-17 – Head too high -3x for 18min – Spikes in end distance. May need to look into adjusting our +/- tolerances to keep these tool off the constraint report. Monitoring.
 
7K-30-R01 – Feed faults – Afternoon shift ELs kept limping tool. Told night shift it needed a rivet present cable. Went in and determined cable was fine. ELs blew out the nose and ran fresh tape in and it ran the rest of the shift without issue. They also noticed the way things were routed it was pulling on one of the pneumatic airlines for the GBSD. Adjusted the routing and had no further issues. Monitor.
 
7K-30-R04 – Step 15 min depth not reached – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Seeing min depth barely out of tolerance on numerous spots. Bodyside inner and main conveyor were nearly empty all night so I did not want to swap it and risk any downtime to an empty system. To get this one back on gun #2 we should be able to add 0.5nm to the trouble programs to achieve those last few tenths of a mm depth and it should be good. Will do it tonight if its still hanging out on gun #1.

Josh McClure noticed the LH side sill b-pillar tape was not installed in proper position (both LWB and SWB). Looking at OIS/JSA it most definitely was not installed correcy. We walked the system all the way to the bodyside decking area and all units had the tape off location. I suspect operator Friday night did this all night so we have a system full or potential air/water issues. We have put framer in hold to keep it from shipping any more units because once body side goes on we cannot fix nor can we inspect if it is in the right location. First good rotation is 3088.

Nights – Snyder – 4/18/19
8X-70-06 – Head too low – 8x for 20min – Faulting on spots 3,4 and 6. Looks like it was taught earlier in the night. I feel like I have seen this one pop up over the past few days. I know we changed the setter on it this past weekend but everything should have been taught by now. Home offset was 5.057mm. Keep an eye on it if faults keep happening and see if it is drifting.
 
6X-180-03 – Material too hard – 3x for 5min – Spot 71 has been the only spot faulting a few times a day over the past few months. Checked error/warning threshold mapping and noticed this spot was not set up correcy. Took care of it. Shouldn’t fault anymore.
 
7G-70-L01 – FDS – 2x for 20min – Screw jammed followed by French revolution of double feeds. TMs called to clear head of screws.
 
8A-120-02 – Head too high – 2x for 20min – Called by Jackey. Tool had actually double riveted in auto. No signs or indications why this would happen. Tool hasn’t faulted since February. It is a small 3mm rivet so I am wondering if the GBSD is retrying and pulling the rivet too far in causing it to fire sideways or on another rivet. Keep an eye on it. For now it is running well so I left it alone.

#4 – 8X-70-02 – Double rivet – 3x for 19min – Started out getting feed faults sporadically and then it escalated to double rivets.  Tool was not pulling tape enough and then firing on a rivet sideways. Ended up damaging punch and nose. TMs and PFs came over and replaced GBSD, nose and punch. No more issues.

6X-20-05 – Rivet not escaped – Mag was swapped and not docked so went into job without rivets. Had to abort program and teach home to get it to dock.
 
6X-140-01 – Feed faults – Sheet said GBSD was swapped but counter was not reset. Looked fairly new. Did run one rivet. Swapped and ran.
 
Rotation 4932 – Ford SWB moonroof was sitting in station 60 framer seg. 1 all weekend with adhesive on cowl side for HFE exposed. Per the ES we are to damage this unit out. Logic automatically did this for us. We removed it as damaged in hopes we could use it as our May teardown. Please track and damage out so it can be pulled at the end of framing respot.
 
7G-90-L01 – Double rivet – New setter throwing double rivet faults. End distance was at ~160mm but nominal was at ~250mm on all spots. Looked at change log and saw a few failed calibrations during swap. We re-homed and calibrated the setter and everything worked fine and looked good. But we were still getting the double rivet faults with wild end distance. Compared to RH side and saw end distance should be at about ~160mm. Change log didn’t indicate any nominal changes…tried to find setter that was swapped in shop but couldn’t. Theory is we may have had the wrong setter on the tool before.
 
8Y-20-02 – Feed faults – Swapped GBSD.
 
9B-220-01 – Profil head stud not made – Tool would not punch stud. Head acted like it was sticking. Found out there were issues Friday with this tool at end of shift and head was swapped. There was no air pressure on the head. Ended up finding the hoses plumbed to the head were installed into the wrong ports. Fixed.
 
Moonroof Hemmer – Plastic was hanging over moonroof hemmer but it has since been removed. We now have water leaking from the room down onto the hemmer.
 
5C hem die – Spring loaded hold down is bent all out of shape and rubber bumper is chewed up. Looks like it has been this way for a long time. Tried to locate parts and couldn’t find anything. See if you have any luck. Photos attached.
 
Some setters would’ve been good black setter candidates.
 
There are a whole bunch of setters in the shop that are either A. not tagged or B. have a red tag but with no data on the tag or the sticker. As we know this will become an issue.

7X-20R-18 101-C3 Pin Clamp Not Retracted - after production checked cables, cleaned and lubricated pin clamp, still faulted on next job.  Noticed that the pin clamp is 90 degrees out so it doesn't even engage the metal in its current configuration.  Took off the plate to see if the shot pin could be rotated 90 degrees and it started getting deep.  Told them to take one apart in the shop to see how its done.  In the meantime the logic has a test edit to ignore that clamp.

The lip for the leveler plate for door 108 extends out but won’t retract.   A solenoid turns on to send hydraulic fluid out to the cylinder to extend the lip.   When it turns off, gravity retracts the lip to the storage position.   The lip is not retracting.  We isolated the cylinder it appears to function as expected.  We believe the issue is the valve inside the hydraulic unit.  It is not allowing flow back to the tank.

Nights – Snyder – 5/1/19
#4 – 6X-90-02 – Toolcheck NOK – 1x for 19min – Failed toolcheck. Broken TOX die. Repaired unit and replaced die.
 
#6 – 6X-80-03 – Head too low – 1x for 18min -  Broken punch. Replaced GBSD, nose and punch.
 
#8 – 6X-90-04 – Head too high – 5x for 13min – Still getting the collapsed rivets. Repaired as needed.
 
#9 – 6X-20-03 – Pusher not retracted – 2x for 12min – We were able to valve it and break it free. It ran the rest of the time without issue. Monitor. May need a feedstick.
 
#4 – 7G-90-L01 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 44min – Happened at lunch. Swapped GBSD and nose. Nose switch stuck on.
 
6Y-150-01/6Y-150-02 – End distance adjustments – Every day/shift we get a couple rivmon faults on these tools. They are just barely out of tolerance. Sometimes on high end and sometimes on low end so adjusting nominal is a never ending bate. Adjusted +/- end distance to 0.4mm. This should eliminate faults. The tool rivets through the HFE so I imagine there is some material inconsistencies in there.
 
6Y-180-01 – FDS – Took gun #1 from shop and put it back in cell. Verified it with a handful of jobs. Seems to be fine.
 
6G-20-01 – Was informed there were SPAC nut slugs all over the cell and backing up in the die causing downtime @ Z29. Appears this slug bin has been neglected. Checked our PMs and it looks like a slug bin PM was never set up for this cell. Note sent to Koontz to get this fixed. For now I sent TMs in to clean up mess and told them to keep an eye on it when doing their rounds.

#6 – 6X-90-04 – Head too high – 9x for 22min – Still faulting on liftgate opening. Rivets are actually high on corner of opening. Repairing as needed. Have not looked into if it’s a batch issue or not.
 
6X-60-01 – Max time exceeded step 9 – 5x for 12min – Faulting on program 8 primarily. May need touched up. They ran everything pretty full so I was not able to get station in hold in time.
 
6Y-180-01 – Step 7 min depth/Step 15 max time – 10x for 20min – Swapped over to gun #1 around lunch. Made changes on spots that were faulting. Got everything pretty much ironed out except program 2 which was faulting for step 7 min depth. ELs swapped back to gun #2 before I got back there. We put gun #1 back on and adjusted step 7 target depth. This eliminated the faults on that program. But it seems that single spot may be clipping the inner clearance hole because it is sometimes stripping out. Maybe we can get the guru or Glardon to touch up that spot with the magical template.
 
#1 – 8A-100-01 – Clinch nut not present with ram advanced – 10x for 1hr23min – Tim had a long downtime over there before he left (see his note). We still faulted a handful of times during the shift. The nut is falling out of the jaw/the punch is not hitting the center of the nut causing it to dry fire. I was never able to actually see it happen so I am not 100% sure what was happening but I do know it was dry firing somehow.
 
#2 – 5A-20-01 – Feed fault – 3x for 36min – EL tried to keep it running but it would not feed at all. Tape was all chewed up. Replaced nose and GBSD and faulted on very next job. Took apart again and found the punch to be mushroomed pretty bad. Changed punch and faults went away.
 
#8 – 9B-245-01 – Clinch nut not present – 4x for 18min – Upside down nut made it to head of gun causing a jam. TMs came and cleared. Error proofing is not installed on this feeder either.

8A100-1W:Broken nut holder. 
Nut holder broken arm. Spare parts ordered over 1 year ago, none on hand. Took pieces to weld shop, no welder on duty and none scheduled in schedule pro. 
Actions (ICA) : 
Took pieces to Stamping and had the tool and die makers weld. Still could not consisteny place nuts and clinch them. Every 3-4 parts we would fault with a no nut present fault due to knocking it out of position. Had already been through the alignment procedure. Disassembled arm from tooling and took to shop and placed on granite surface. Identified that it was bent in a downward direction. Grabbed a straightened one, (These arms have been on order for over a year as well and not delivered which is why we have to straighten them) 
Sensors for location have a 10mm margin for error and parts only have 4mm of tolerance (2 per side). The arm can be off location by 10mm and still read in position. 
Actions (PCA) : 
Installation of laser switch to positively locate arm position before ram can travel.",,"8A-100 REO, in addition to 4D corrective actions we also added a 2 second delay before firing ram output to help ensure placement arm position.

No more issues.
 
#3 – 6Y-110-01 – Feed fault – 2x for 19min – No more issues after afternoon shift worked on it.
 
#8 – 6Y-180-01 – FDS – 4x for 14min – No new occurrences while I was here. Monitoring.
 
#9 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 8x for 13min – No new occurrences while I was here. Monitoring.
 
6X-90-04 – Didn’t kill us tonight but still faulting here and there.
 
6X-190-01 – Head too low, double rivet, could not finish retract/time delay – 25min – Tool began throwing head too low faults. End distance was 4mm out of tolerance. Rivets looked actually a lite high but within spec. Home offset and tool stroke were good. TMs came and inspected tool and checked punch. All was good. Sent back in and faulted again. Inspected joint along with metal and found nothing wrong. Adjusted velocity to bring rivets down and put in teach 100 after sending unit as suspect. Very next job tool timed out due to the head not returning back. When reset we got “can’t finish retract” faults. Tried manually moving setter home but it wouldn’t return. Had to go in and manually move the tool off the job and bring it out to maintenance. 160072 setter and 132 punch were swapped. Setter had been rebuilt once and only had 263k cycles on it this go-round. First time it was rebuilt it only lasted 571k cycles. We will move this setter from shop and send it out FRACAS and see what we can get.
 
#1 – 9A-30-02 -  Nut not present – 3x for 53min – No new occurrences while I was here. Also don’t know what happened over there. Will keep an eye on it tonight.
 
#2 – 5G-005-LH – Profil feed not complete – 2x for 30min – No new occurrences while I was here. Don’t know what happened but this fault usually happens when light screen is broken. Will monitor.
 
7K-20-L01 – Tried to swap gun around 1am but couldn’t run a screw. Went in and found the gun was bent pretty badly. Looks like it had been crashed. Swapped back to gun #2 to get through shift. I was told there were 2 guns on bench in shop. 1 had a bad belt and the other was ready to be tested. Neither had good tags on them telling us which was which. We put the one that looked good on the test stand and found the belt was broken on that one. Tested the other one on the bench successfully and took it over to LH bodysides to be installed. Gun #1 for 7K-20-L01 has been pulled out and put in the shop to be rebuilt. It is pretty bent so it may need a new slide or just an alignment. We will see as we get into it. 2 RH spindle guns on bench need follow up. 1 with a broken belt and the other being the one just mentioned. Also please ensure guns are being tagged with detail through rebuild process.","#4 & #5 main   Replaced the EC6M module.

Nights – Snyder – 5/9/19
7L-30-R03 – Got a few 553 SWB units where spot #1 rivet was tumbled requiring repair. Watched tool run for over 30min and did not see it happen again. Rivmon history shows quite a few faults on this spot so I believe we are catching it when it happens although I am not sure why. Checked nose for rub marks and dint see anything. Also made sure nose switch cable wasn’t shorting out causing an over pull on the tape which would then tumble the small 3mm rivet. We plan to step through a 553 SWB Sunday night to see if the nose is clipping a clamp or something.

Nights – Snyder – 5/12/19
6W-40-11 – Touch up not complete. Had issues with overhead conveyor chain B tension switch so we were working on that. Also only had 1 base roof unit (the one that was lined up Friday night for it to get done this weekend). That one unit was released right when the guys got here so it was already past the station when I got over there.
 
LHBS overhead conveyor – Chain B tension fault – When we went to start up the conveyor would not cycle the pallets and we had a tension fault. Appears there may have been a pallet hung up. We were able to reset it once and everything cycled but it continued to come back. Chain was running while faulted. Looked into logic and saw the chain B tension prox was not made. When EL went upstairs to verify the prox was just barely off. He adjusted the prox slighy (didn’t need tools) the fault cleared and we were able to cycle a few jobs without any issues. Unfortunately did not grab the pallet number but something to keep an eye on.

Nights – Snyder – 5/13/19
#1 – 6X-20-05 – Head too high – 28x for 47min – Tool began with only 1 fault for excessive force. Noticed force had jumped up but it appeared this saw tooth pattern was typical for that spot. Shory after it began faulting some more. Investigated further and found the end distance trending low and the peak force trending high on all spots. Went in and checked the setter to see if it was loose and it wasn’t. Continued to fault. The trends indicated the setter was on its way out/broken shear pin. Noticing it was higher force I went in and put the setter motor cover template on to check clearances.  With only about 30 jobs left we decided to let it limp until end of shift. Towards end the tool was faulting nearly end of spot. We made it until end of production and installed a brand new BLACK 250102 setter on tool. Original setter had 804k cycles on it at 62kN average force. Tool didn’t fault and I checked rivets…they looked good. We only ran about 5 jobs so it may need rivmon teaching follow-up as more models are introduced.
 
#6 – 6X-20-05 – Excessive tool force – 6x for 14min – See above.
 
#10 – 6Y-180-02 – FDS – 1x for 10min – Afternoon shift had a fault where the bit and jaws broke on gun #1. Gun was swapped to finish shift. Between shifts TMs replaced head and bit. Back on gun #1.
 
#6 – 5B-40-02 – Feed fault – 3x for 24min – EL tried to keep tool running but eventually had to call for GBSD swap. Ran after swap.
 
5A-20-01 – Hand grenade – Was told there was a temp encoder cable ran on tool but the existing was found to be just loose after. It seemed to be an innocent unplug and plug in. Stopped line and went in to do so and then quickly realized the connector on the robot was broken in pieces. ELs were able to piece it together and got the temp external cable hooked back up. This will need to be followed up by running an encoder cable THROUGH the robot. Not sure if we have done this yet but for now that external temp cable is going to have to stay.

 ","Main #6) S30 AIS 1 To GLX No Communications Fault FB1[75].23
 
Had this fault coming out of lunch. Spoke with Dave Cox and he stated that he unplugged the AIS Box due to the horn continously beeping. Once production resumed, 8C-030-R1 remained in the pounce position and would not set the part in the fixture. Found that the missing condition for the Clear To Set down was ""EP Not Released."" The display on the AIS was showing ""NO BC"" and ""No Broadcast available for vehicle."" Attempted to manually insert the rotation number/CID and reboot the AIS with no luck.  Eventually wound up bypassing the AIS via the PanelView.

Nights – Snyder – 5/14/19
I would say it was a quiet night but don’t want to jinx us…so it was an absolutely horrendous night.
 
7G-70-L01 – FDS – 11x for 56min – Had about 40min of downtime when I got here. We did have a few more occurrences. Mainly having depth faults in step 7 and 4. Screw was hanging up in the head assembly. Had TMs come over and disassemble and we found the baffle was gummed up with adhesive not allowing the screw to feed. TMs installed a new head assembly without baffle. Ran better but didn’t run too long after this. Monitor. French is going to line up touching up adhesive path to get it out of the clearance holes tomorrow. This should greay reduce downtime and the constant maintenance we are doing on this tool.
 
8E-240-02 – Head too high – 5x for 14min – Faulting on quite a few spots. End distance was consisteny trenching low. Adjusted nominal and did not have any more issues.

#9 – 6Y-180-02 – Torque sensor calibration faults – 2x for 8min – Tool would fault on same spot inside the cab for torque sensor calibration. Tool passed friction test and would run other screws. Recent history says transducer, transducer cable and belt have been receny replaced on this one. Runs fine on gun #2. Ran a temporary signal cable from the gun to the robot jumping out the ATI.

We pieced it together to get it to run but it still needs another screw to complete it. I looked and TMs looked and didn’t find any. Joe T said Tim Mitchell stocked shop with them. I will have him locate some in the AM. Will need follow up.

Unit 3376 – This unit will arrive to metal finish with concern from T23. Rivmon caught some type of plastic stuck between the bodyside/hinge pillar and cowl side. This created a defective rivet and a gap in the area.

Put new nose in and saw it clip the part ripping it from the GBSD. Went in and found there was a 5982 nose installed when it should have been a 5193 which is substantially shorter in length. Our swap sheet was wrong and the TMs must have not noticed the 2+in difference in the noses when they swapped.

Nights – Snyder – 5/22/19
#2 – 6X-180-01 – Nose switch fault – Head a loud crack as tool riveted. Punch broke off in the nose. Had difficulty removing the GBSD because it was stuck up in the setter. Removed motor cover to lower GBSD. When we went to remove GBSD we realized this GBSD could not be removed without removing the die (c-frame throat too shallow). Removed die and then proceeded with removing GBSD. Once GBSD was off we replaced the broken punch, reinstalled a  new GBSD and nose and then homed the tool before sending it back into production. No more issues.
 
#5/#6 – 6X-20-14 – Head too high/Head too low – 7x for 20min – No more issues after Dave was over there. Monitor.
 
6Y-180-01/6Y-180-01 – FDS – Seems they were acting up early in the shift but did not have anything while I was here. Night shift ELs said they had no issues. Monitor.
 
8F-125-01 – Torque not OK – 7x for 19min – Was told to investigate but there were no more faults the rest of shift. I know we are rotating a lot of new C-crew operators in. Perhaps this is the issue? I have Lindley keeping an eye on it and he will get with me with any issues he has.
 
8F-120-04 Gun #1 – TMs attempted to align punch and die. Will need to be verified on production metal.
 
Got all the 1st shift TMs bumpcaps. They are all aware and on board with using them anytime they go in the cell.

Attempted to find Load Zone Release Prox to see why it was not made. At production's request, we swapped S090R06 over to picking from FX1 instead of CV2 until lunch. During production's lunch, found that Pallet 14B was about 4 inches away from the Load Release Zone Clear Prox. Tested the next pallet with the same result. Ultimately decided to increase the preset value of the ""To Zone Clear Transition Timer"" from 16000 to 19000. Ran several pallets with no further issues.

8X-005-03: Tool faulted for “Head too high/low” faults, all spots. 
Inspector pulled part and verified the rivets were good. 
Had EL re-home the setter to ensure home-to-backstop position and to rule out possible broken shear pin. Setter homed correcy, several times. 
Sent tool back in to rivet, where it was noticed that the setter appeared to be moving in the C-frame. 
Upon further investigation, we determined that the M1947 lock nut at the end of the actuator, on the setter itself, had worked itself loose. 
Instead of attempting to tighten it in place, it was faster to change the setter out. Once the new setter had been homed and calibrated, no further issues at this station. 
Possible root cause is the lock nut not being tightened to the 80Nm torque, extension tube not tightened to 60Nm torque, or a collision of setter with other object (although there was no collision detect present)

Nights – Snyder – 6/3/19
#1 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS step 14 max time exceeded – 9x for 54min – Fault was latched when we were down on 8Y-10-06. This also occurred at lunch. Gun was on gun #1 because it was faulting. Swapped over to gun #2 to see what was going on and found it faulting on SWB program 26. Made adjustments to step 8 and 13 pressure and step 9 depth. Did not have any more issues with the tool after this. Still on gun #2.
 
#7 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 6x for 16min – Various faults on gun #1. Went to swap to gun #2 to troubleshoot and things went downhill fast. Tool went to pick up and just sat there. Went in to find one of the tool present prox switches on the robot side ATI was broken. The pins had come off the connector and the prox we bent a bit and barely hanging there. Spent quite a bit of time trying to locate a new switch and cable. Ended up having to rig up the broken one to run. Aborted our swap and went back to gun #1 because we could not pass an offset with gun #2. New cable and switch installed between shifts and analog depth sensor adjusted. Got the analog depth sensor tuned in but now it won’t see the “advanced” for the eject screw. Was running out of time so we went ahead and swapped back to gun #1. Will mess with it more tonight when I come in.
 
#8 – 6X-190-03 – Feed fault – 2x for 15min – EL reset a few times but feed faults kept coming back and tape was getting chewed up. TMs and PFs swapped GBSD. No more issues.
 
7K-30-L05 – Step 14 max time exceeded – 4x for 5min – Faulting on SWB programs. Mainly program 1. Went in and verified we weren’t hitting clearance hole. Screw was right in the center but having trouble forming threads in the hydroform. Bit was slighy rounded so we changed that first. Still faulted. Increased pressure in step 8 and 13 and did not have any more faults. Monitor.
 
7L-30-R03 – Head too low – Tumbled rivets still happening intermitteny. This has happened a few times over the past month or so on 553 SWB outers only. With a new nose and GBSD I lined ELs up to step robot through 553 SWB to ensure we were clipping anything with the nose. Happened again so we did it real quick and found the tab that was being riveted was bent coming from stamping. I am confident this is causing our problem.  Founds racks upon racks with the bent tab.  straightened out before racks were loaded into cell and we did not see it happen again. Photo of bent tab attached. Monitor.

Nights – Snyder – 6/4/19
#1 – 8Y-40-06 – Feed fault – 6x for 51min – Appears afternoon shift guy left this one limping and was faulted as the 11pm guys were coming in. TMs and PFs got over there and changed GBSD, nose and punch. Still could not get rivet present to make. The light on the cable was on (which had us scratching our head a bit) but we did not see the light on the I/O block and we were not seeing it made on the Henrob HMI. Luckily had a rivet present cable on the cart which was installed. This fixed the issue and the tool ran the rest of the shift.
 
#5 – 8X-30-02 – 1x for 21min – Inspector informed me there were still skips in adhesive path. The fault occurred when we went in at lunch and stepped program through. Found a few spots where nozzle was still dragging. Adjusted program and had inspector verify issues no longer existed. Looks good now.
 
#1 – 8A-100-01 – Nut not present – Nut not transferring to the jaw properly. Found the nut level prox on the chuting had been removed from the arm coming of the frame of the press and pushing up which then caused the chuting to sag and misfeed nuts. Adjusted chuting to alleviate bends with cable ties which helped the issue. If the prox was moved for a reason it needs to be supported properly.

Between shifts. 
8Y10-5: Worked on gun 2, slide/bearings/alignment/head assembly. 
 
Rebuilt GBSD's
 
Faults/Downtime:
7L30-4: Several clinch faults but we could not tell what the faults were because the HMI was not talking to controller. Temped in another HMI, needs follow up at shift end to install into cabinet. Faults seemed to stop after connecting the new HMI
 
6X180-4: Feed faults. Swapped GBSD
 
6X180-4: Immediately after swapping the  GBSD it faulted with head too high which conflicted with the sheared off die we found. Replaced die and got head too low fault on the next rivet, checked good. Put in teach 100 and spot checked a couple and they were good.
 
Nights – Snyder – 6/5/19
#2 – 6X-20-02 – Rivet not trapped – 2x for 37min – First occurrence was happening as I was getting here. We found 4 rivets stuck behind pusher. Removed tube to clear those and put back in. Ran for a few hours but faulted again. Second time we installed a new feedstick and did not have any more issues.
 
#4 – 6Y-80-09 – FDS – 2x for 34min – Head full of adhesive causing it to bind up. Replaced head and then it faulted again. Found foot on head we installed was bent. Put a new foot on and it ran. But was faulting on SWB units. Between shifts ELs touched up program.
 
#8 – 7L-40-L03 – Clinch – Temped HMI has been successfully installed into panel. Running well.
 
#10 – 6X-20-04 – Rivet stuck in tube – 1x for 22min – All TMs were on other breakdowns. Pulled them off framing respot which was blocked to PTS and had them come to this one. EL reset fault for multiple rivets and they cleared them and it ran.
 
#1 – 7G-20-L01 – Valve output failure – 11x for 1hr51min – Called numerous times for escapement binding. TMs and PFs looked ay cylinder and could not get it to cycle. PF took apart and oiled it which allowed it to cycle. Happened again a bit later. This time found nuts stuck. TMs cut/filed the chuting and adjusted it to remove a bend in it that was causing nuts to jam up at escapement. Ran well after this.
 
#2 – 9A-20-R01 – Esc not advanced – 7x for 1hr42min – Worked on this for what seemed like forever. Escapement wouldn’t advance all the way. Took apart and cleaned/cleared multiple times. Still kept happening. Went out and inspected tool and found spring that pushes the nuts onto the jaw was broken which was causing the nuts to not feed all the way to the head which then caused resistance on the feeder escapement pusher. This did not allow it to advance fully. Replace spring…will need to keep an eye on at start up. May need new cylinder. We did not have any on hand or in stores. Joe T ordered some.
 
#9 – 7G-70-L01 – FDS – 7x for 24min – Getting some depth faults here and there. Calls for CSAN and does it successfully and takes off fine. If issues continues it may need a new head. This one is prone to getting gummed up. Was running okay last time I was over there. Monitor.

#2 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 23x for 51min – Multiple faults in multiple areas on gun #1. I still have not had the chance to dive into gun #2 not passing and offset yet. Failed to do so again tonight. Need to find out the problem with gun #1 as well but didn’t get over there. McClure kept the line running without impeding production all night. He also loaded old “known good” screw programs which did seem to slow down the faults. Only 6 faults after this. 17 previous.
 
#4 – 6Y-80-09 – FDS – 15x for 36min – Step 7 faults still intermitteny. Not sure why all the sudden we are missing the holes on stuffer plate. Need to figure out if the plate is the issue or if something is loose on the gun. I was over there with them the night before and didn’t see anything glaringly obvious on the tool.
 
#8 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 12x for 27min – Swapped it back over to gun #2 which ran well. Also loaded known good screw programs to this tool as well which seemed to help.
 
8X-30-02 – Adhesive thin/skipping on RH front side of front ladder-to-dash. Lindley going through the program between shifts again.
 
7K-40-L08 – Step 7 min depth not reached – Faulting on program 1. Off tolerance by no more than 0.5mm. Adjusted step 7 analog depth target. No more issues.
 
6X-80-03 – Broken Henrob die. Faulted on the unit it broke on. Replace die and repaired unit 0326.
 
#2 – 8A-100-01 – Nut not present – 5x for 1hr33min – Still fighting the issues with the nut feeding to jaws. Adjusted the jaw opening tension also adjusted the angle/height of the nut feed chuting which seemed to help. Still needs to be monitored. Maybe the feed arm is not straight up and down which is causing nut to lift. Or maybe we could add a delay to let the nut sete? Did feed arms ever come in from when we broke that last one a month or so ago?
 
#3 – 8A-120-01 – PP still on – 5x for 1hr22min – Fault is a result of us working on tool above.
 
#4 – 9C-220-01 – Profil head stud not made – 5x for 1hr16min – Joe Jackey said it wouldn’t see stud but he could go in and shake the head and get it to make. He checked the switch and adjusted it but still has issue. Thought stud was hanging up in head so TMs came and took head apart and cleaned it. This seemed to have eliminated that issue for now but then it turned into another issue.
 
#5 – 9C-220-01 – REO press pressurized not on – 4x for 1hr01min -  Press not seeing pressurized.
 
#7 – 8A-100-01 – Clinch valve output failure – 6x for 44min – Fault a reset of us working on press.
 
#9 – 8A-140-01 – Feed fault low rivets – 1x for 33min – Tool ran out of rivets but Joe Jackey and the rest of us were tied up on cowl dash. Had to call Clinton over to help us out and get the cell back running.

#2 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 16x for 44min – Within the first couple hours of the shift we had nearly 10 faults. Inspectors informed me all but one were good units requiring no repair. Made some depth and torque adjustments which led to us only have 6 the remainder of the shift.

Re-homed and sent back in to run. Last about 10min and faulted again. Was only 0.15mm out of tolerance. Had inspector buy off part and put in teach 100. Once teach was done it began faulting again with a drifted home offset and would not return home. Rivets were now actually bad. Swapped setter which only had 115k cycles on it.
 
8X-30-02 – Adhesive thinning and skips continue. Watched it run for a while and then slowed the robot down. This helped a lite but not much. Checked parts for excess oil and they seemed to be fine. Went in and touched up the 2 points it was skipping…the nozzle was pretty far off the part and we moved it closer by about 4mm. This helped some but still not 100%. We then went into the robot program and slowed down both the approach point and the actual point for the suspect bead from 300mm/s to 250mm/s. Watched over a dozen parts run without issue after this. Still running well. Inspector is monitoring though.",,,,,,"Need to work on Roof perceptron.   We have been cycling power to keep it running.     The problem appears to be with camera 5.

Put a “new” rebuilt gun from shop in the cell and pulled the one in there out under the assumption the magnet on the main slide was bad. Gun from shop wouldn’t run because the BE1R sensor would not turn off. Replaced sensor but then it would not pass an offset. This now leads me to believe we have a toolside ATI signal issue. Gun #1 runs fine in regards to depth signals. Ran out of time so it will need to be worked on between shifts. I’d try jumping out ATI first if we can get the cables from framer respot area.

#3 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 15x for 27min – Depth faults on both step 15 and 7 on a few programs. Made some minor adjustments on torque. Had 11 faults as of 10pm and we ended up with 15. I think the changes made an improvement. Continuing to monitor. Would really need to be able to see each fault and check if screws are indeed high or not to nail down those step 15 faults.
 
#4 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 12x for 24min – Faulting on programs 30 and 20 for step 15 min depth. It is saying depth is -2.0mm which is the upper end of where I am comfortable adjusting. Having McClure increase torque on those programs to try and bring depth down tighter. Monitor.
Also tried to swap over to gun #2 again with the new toolside ATI. Saw the same problem with the tool not being able to pass an offset. We did not have any parts/units to run in order to mess with it. Will swap it again tonight with some units held and try to figure it out. I am honesy stumped…2nd gun acting the same way but the other tool runs fine in this aspect.
 
#1 – 9C-240-01 – Head too low – 1x for 36min – Joe Jackey said it was up in less than 10min. FIS shows 36min. There were no other major problems with the tool just a rivmon fault due to end distance being slighy out of tolerance. Did not repeat.

Front Pan Ped Guns – Dahl brothers went to further investigate Joe Jackeys concerns with the tape cutters. They found areas to improve where the tape transitions from the GBSD to the exit tube/cutter. They are adding length to the exit tube to cover the GBSD so it does not allow the tape to curl out and spool up on the floor like it does occasionally. They will probably have most of it complete tonight. I will follow up with them before I leave. If it’s not done I am sure it’ll be done tomorrow night.",,,,,,"FIS monitor went out in the framer 2 crib sometime yesterday.  55"" monitor none on hand in stores.

Sub #2) Front Doors - 5B-040-R4 - Worked with Rick Mattingly to resolve the FB4[6].10 S040R04E1B1 Robot Process IO Communication fault. Upon arrival, the robot was in the pounce position with a door picked. The Leoni package was twisted up under the J4 knuckle. The pack had been disconnected from the clamp at the the EOAT which allowed it to get bunched up in this manner. Replaced the high flex ethernet cable with a new one and attempted to run again. Within a few cycles, we had the same issue. Eventually had to put another new cable on and re-secure the Leoni to the EOAT clamp. Joe Layne is going to look at re-routing the ethernet cable in between shifts. Monitored with no further issues.",,,,,"Recently we have been getting numerous cowl to dash racks damaged again.

Nights – Snyder – 6/11/19
#1 – 6Y-80-09 – FDS – 10x for 50min – Dave said we were having numerous faults. When I got in it was faulted but blocked to PTS. Brought gun out to gate and checked it out and found the head had a lot of play in it. Line started moving so we swapped over to gun #1. Gun #1 didn’t run perfect but did pretty well. Between shifts TMs tightened up the linear bearing rails to remove the play in the head.
 
#2 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 16x for 44min – Downtime was a result of it being in a faulted state during lunch. Had a total of 10 faults while I was here. Found jaws were too tight and bit was worn on gun #1. Fixed that and it ran for a bit. Eventually we swapped over to gun #2 to see how it would run and it did well. Monitor gun #2.
 
#3/#5 – 6Y-180-02 – FDS – 7x for 31min – After Dave’s afternoon crew replaced the head and went over gun we only had 1 more fault the rest of shift. Still monitoring.
 
#4 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 9x for 21min – 3 faults while I was here. None of which I was able to attend or work on. Looking at history it appears there are some step 7 depth issues going on at -44mm. Appears screw could occasionally be hanging up in the head. Or the jaws could have been too tight.
 
#1 – 7G-70-L01 – FDS – 5x for 59min – Was swapped over on afternoons after the 1hr of downtime. Around 11pm I went over and had Gary Taylor swap it back to gun #2. TMs came and cleaned the head as the screws were hanging up in it. After this we did not have another fault the entire shift.
 
#5 – 7G-50-L01 – FDS – 2x for 24min – This one was also swapped by afternoon shift. At the same time we were working on 70-L01 I had Gary swap this one because the faults looked like something we could get out of. During swap tool would not finish eject because the foot was bent. TMs replaced foot and we sent it in to run. Tool went in to screw first screw and faulted for min depth not reached. Went and looked at the location and found the gun was over an inch off the clearance hole. Told Gary it appears the tool itself is bent and we needed to get it home and swap back to gun #1. He hit skip remaining to get it off the job and to maintenance. The tool stepped through the rest of the program and then came to maintenance. Instead of stopping it went right back in and crashed really hard into the part. Not entirely sure why this happened or how it happened…will need to be recreated. We got gun home and swapped back to gun #1. Between shifts TMs pulled the crashed gun from the cell and installed another LH spindle gun in the stand. Will need a more competent robot guy to step through program and make sure the new gun is hitting clearance holes. Also step through to see what caused the crash condition.
 
7K-40-L08 – Step 7 min depth – Faulting on program 3. A few tenths out of tolerance. Adjusted step 7 depth. No more issues.
 
8X-30-02 – Inspector said it was skipping again. This time in a different spot. Josh McClure went in and touched up some spots, adjusted some starts and stops and slowed down a few points. Watched it run for a while and inspector did not have any further concerns.
 
8G-320-01 – Head too high – 3x for 10min – Spot 2 trending high. Adjusted nominal.

But I saw a couple of VFD faults on the C04VL14 elevator.  I looked in FIS and we have had 25 VFD faults so far thru the month of June.  None in May.  Apparently the elevator always faults in the same spot.  About ¾ the way down and when lowering.  Myself and Leo used the Flir camera looking for hot spots in the cabinet but found none.  Motor or brake is not hot.  No loud noises or other obvious issues found.  I did notice the coupling between the output shaft of the gearbox and the elevator shaft is coming apart.  About a 1/2” gap between the halves.   I will get it slide back together Sunday night with Vessels and Graf.  I looked at the couplings on the other 2 elevators and they are not coming apart.  I was told Jeremy Mattingly made a parameter change Friday night, told he increased the decel time of the elevator by 1 second.   
 
I would be a good body shop project to add a back drive motor to the three elevators that don’t have them.  And a backup VFD.

ALL WEBERS ON GUN #2
8Y-10-05 – Swapped to gun #2 and ran parts. McClure verified robot programs. Please do not have Rosselot touch up programs the very next shift after McClure does. 1 step forward 2 steps back. Also is kind of a slap in the face to the last guy to do it. Losing its effectiveness.
 
8Y-10-06 – Signal cable was routed internal to the IGUS this weekend. I suspect the signal cable that was on it is fine. Don’t throw it away. Swapped to gun #2. Failed offset still. Had to adjust analog depth sensor incrementally.
 
7G-50-L01 – Swapped to gun #2. Failed offset. Had to adjust analog depth sensor incrementally. Once it was set we stepped the robot through the first part and touched up all points to the new gun. Looks good and ran parts fine.
 
6Y-110-02 – Swapped back to gun #2. Gun was PM’d over the weekend eliminating the issue we had with it sticking and hanging up.",,,,,"We capped off the open air line on the Rear Door Line lockout station.  Safety issue found during ECPL Refresher.

7K30L-2: Was still skipping, program was modified and we removed the extra step added. Looks much better.   Increased Minimum voltage to .7 volt
 
6Y110-2: Step 7 faults. Slide appears to be hanging up. Follow up needed. 
 
8F110-1: Head too low x6. Verified head height and nominalized the affected spots but had to go back and verifiy again and teach them. 
 
8F125-1: Head too high x9. Heads are too high, not sure what's happening. We grabbed spider stock from a different bin and we ran for a while then they came back. Contacted Jared about the rivet die combination change that was supposed to happen several months ago. He's looking into it, I'm holding my breath. I don't want to adjust velocity on an intermittent fault.

Nights – Snyder – 6/17/19
#3 – 6X-20-02 – Rivet not trapped – 1x for 33min – Happened during afternoons. Did not re-occur after feedstick swap.
 
#6 – 6X-40-05 – Head too low – 7x for 24min – Happened during afternoons. No more issues after re-torqueing the setter.
 
#7 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 13x for 22min – McClure babysat it. Made a few changes. Still on gun #2.
 
#8 – 6Y-80-09 – FDS – 10x for 21min – No more faults after Glardon touch up and adjustments.
 
6Y-110-02 – FDS – 3x for 12min – Gun was swapped to gun #1 on afternoons. Between shifts TMs replaced head on gun #2. It was pretty gummed up. Back on gun #2.
 
#1 – 8F-125-01 – Head too high – 11x for 45min – Faulted right after Dave left. Velocity was adjusted from 290 to 310mm/s on spot 18. Button was fractured and not formed really on that one spot. Brought velocity back down to 290mm/s. Next part came and looked good. Next part came and had the weird button. Head height was good. Group of 17…told inspector to keep an eye and make sure the problem didn’t start spreading to other spots. Did not hear anything the rest of the shift. I checked a few more parts through the night and did not see any bad buttons.
 
#2 – 7B-20-01 – Time delay exceeded – 4x for 40min – Feed faults followed by about 2 dozen nose switch faults that were reset by Hatcher. TMs were called to check out setter. When they got there they could not remove the GBSD because the punch was so destroyed from all the faults being reset. Finally got it off with a hammer. Replaced the punch, nose, GBSD and re-homed tool and did not have any more issues.
 
#3 – 9A-40-02 – FDS – 4x for 35min – Only 1 fault after afternoons. Monitored but did not see it fault. Will continue to watch to make sure it doesn’t spiral out of control.
 
#4 – 7G-50-L01 – FDS – 12x for 27min – Got the text gun was swapped. Was already running on gun #1 and I knew gun #2 wouldn’t work out any better. Went over there and found Sauer…watching gun #2 run it was obvious spots 1 and 2 needed to be touched up. Asked him to do so but he said he didn’t know how. Had to go fetch another EL to do the job. Brad Wagner came and touched up programs. We let it run but it faulted again for min depth with bad screw. Tool was centered on the hole but it appeared to be “flexing” or “sliding” forward when it went to screw. Touched up again. Let it run…ran a couple parts but saw the same issue. Had Brad touch up again but put a slight forward lean on the gun to keep it from sliding forward. Once we did this it ran better but began faulting on step 14. Adjusted pressure in step 8 and 13 on spots 1 and 2 and did not have any more issues.
 
#6 – 7G-70-L01 – FDS – 1x for 22min – Tool faulted because we threw 50-01 in teach during its cycle. Sat faulted until we sorted out 50-01.
 
#9 – 8F-110-01 – Head too low – 5x for 19 – Was on top X but did not fault at all after the afternoon shift adjustments.
 
8A-140-01 Gun 1 – Feed faults. Changed GBSD but it did not fix the issue. Punch was mushroomed. Changed punch. No more issues.

8A-100-01 – Nut not present. Chuting emptied itself of nuts. Joe says when this happens the air pressure causes the nut to float in the jaw causing faults. Once it fills back up it feeds fine. Chuting is set to be replaced over shutdown. We will look at exhaust hole locations and size when routing to see if we can fix this issue.

Nights – Snyder – 6/25/19
#4 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 6x for 15min – 2 faults for the 5hrs we ran while I was here. I was checking in with McClure on it and he said he wasn’t having issues.
 
#6 – 7K-40-R02 – Step 7 min depth not reached – 9x for 14min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Faulting on gun #2 program 1 only. About 2mm out of tolerance on step 7. Was going to open it up but the top sheet is 2mm thick so I had them touch up between shifts. Joe Thompson said it was about half off the hole. Touched up program. Back on gun #2. Monitor at start up.
 
#2 – 7G-70-L01 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 12x for 38min – Was on gun #1 when I got here. Faulting on step 7 max depth at a depth of +0.9-+2.0mm (no screw present). Been fighting this one most the week. Between shifts had Roy Drake swap gun and take it to maintenance position. Luckily the maintenance position is on its side like it is when it is running through the screw program. We manually fed a screw out to the brake and then fed it to the nose with a bit out of the gun. The screw made it to the nose. We then put the bit in and fed one and it did not make it to the nose. We then adjusted the floating head assembly thinking that was root cause. Once we did this we attempted to feed another screw. The screw did not make it to the jaw and we could not see it in the head. We then noticed the rigid feed tube had backed itself off of the coupling that screws it into the head assembly. We removed the head assembly and tube and tightened everything back up and put it together. Fed multiple screws successfully and ran 3 parts without issue. I believe the tube backing off left a gap that allowed the screw to get hung up before reaching the head. Back on gun #2 good to go.

8Y-010-06: Screw faults 19 times, start with Weber program 27 on the SWB.  During the repair noticed that the screw was on the edge of the hole on the rear sill.  At break touch up robot program point for program 27.   Shory after break the gun started faulting on Weber  program 21 LWB.  The screw was also hitting on the edge of the hole.

Nights – Snyder – 6/26/19
#6 – 8Y-20-03 – Head too low – 9x for 23min – Did not fault again after afternoon adjustments.
 
6X-40-05 – Head too low – Broken die. FIS does not show much downtime but we lost over an hour. I was not aware it was down until about an hour into breakdown. Die broke off at stem and set screw holding die in stripped out. 1 unit was repaired. Tool faulted right away. TMs were in the shop drilling out set screw when I found out it was down. At this time we ordered a new die post but by the time we got out to stores and received the order the TMs had completed surgery on the original post and were installing it back into the c-frame with a new die. Informed them next time to let me know and we will get a new post as opposed to operating on one during production.
 
7L-40-L03 – Force < min force – 5x for 10min – Faulted out a few times. Inspector checked clinches and they were good. EL went in and cleaned adhesive off the die but it still faulted a few times. Force was 0.1kN out of tolerance on program 21. Adjusted minimum tolerance on that program and did not see the issue repeat.
 
#1 – 7G-50-L01 – FDS – 18x for 1hr8min – Was swapped to gun #1 just as we were getting here. Not sure why. Got a call from Roy Drake saying he was having issues with gun #1 as well. Went over there and tool was faulting on every part for a strip out on program 4 only. With it being only one spot we started checking robot programming to make sure we were losing the threads on a clearance hole. Watched it run and it was sliding forward when it screwed causing it to clip the hole. Had Roy adjust the program so it was off-center from the beginning and put an angle on the gun to help it overcome to force causing it to slide. Still faulting…watched it run and the screw was now dead center but still faulting only on that one spot. “New Guy” Dave had a great idea to have the Weber call schedule 3 for spot 4 to rule out Weber program as opposed to comparing and changing. We did this for 1 part and still had the same faults so we changed it back. We then noticed the head of the screw was chewed up. Checked bit and found it to be rounded out. Called TMs to replace bit and accideny hit “go to maintenance w/o tool”. This caused a lite bit of a mess. Got out of that. Replaced bit and it ran fine…lesson learned…check bit first even if it isn’t faulting anywhere else.
 
#3 – 7G-50-L01 – Collision detect – 2x for 42min – Had 1 collision detect early in the night for 20min and then we had one while working on it. When tool change is initiated it collisions out dropping the gun off into the stand. You are able to just reset it and continue. Was going to have Roy step through TC program to make sure it is all square but they ran late because of downtime.
 
#4 – 7G-60-L01 – Sealer cycle interrupted – 3x for 28min – Result of us stopping line before it was done. Whoops.
 
#5 – 7G-70-L01 – FDS – 2x for 21min – Tool faulted when we dropped auto teaching 50-01. Did not get reset until we got done working on 50-01.

Went in to look at the gun and it was crashed worse than any gun I’ve seen before. The guide rods for the active jaw have been snapped and the foot, head and jaws are all mangled up pretty good. We had 3 RH spindle guns in the shop. 1 being on the test stand. The one on the stand would not pass an offset. Messed with analog depth sensor.

Millwrights told electricians they needed the motor brake disabled to be able to turn the coupling by hand to align it with elevator when swapping drives.  That is only when swapping main drive to standby drive, when swapping standby to main it is not necessary.  Forgot to tell the electricians that.  Electricians edited around the brake circuit in the PLC.  In the meantime millwrights finished swapping the drives, unpinned the elevator and came out.  When the gates were closed and gates reset, the elevator took off up.  And over traveled.  When the electricians tried to lower the elevator, the Bart Simpson on the table got on the wrong side of its trigger and bent the Bart Simpson on the table.  Millwrights heated and straightened the Bart Simpson.  We ran the elevator up in automatic with no issue.           ",,"All the underbody respot and underbody main robots have been moved to zero position or close to it for robot lubrication.
Replaced the two damaged driven rollers on roll bed #18 in the pallet farm.  Could not find new replacement rollers.  Revisited the donor table on the southwest corner of the upper level of the pallet farm and swapped rollers between the two tables.   I have ordered some rollers thru stores that may be the correct ones.  Els found blown fuse in panel for drive motor for lift table #32.  Fuse replaced and table working.

Phil Dahl and Todd Dahl completed rebuilding the guns on the bench in the shop. They have all been tested and passed. One of the guns had the connection for the proportional valve snapped off. The cable and its connector were good but the pins and connector in the valve were broken. Tried to find our specific valve in stores with no luck. Found one labeled for 558 but it had a balance of zero. Talked to 558 JE and he said he had a handful in his shop so he gave me one. The one he provided is not exacy the same as the one on our gun. Ours is a lite slimmer and has a different part number. The pushlock fitting is also a different style. Working with PF to locate fittings and exhaust port for the new proportional valve. However both valves have the same voltage, current and air pressure ratings so I don’t see it being an issue. I will work on getting our specific valve set up in stores though.
 
Jeff Fessel and Terry Lockhart continued to work on guide roller project for Satterwhite.
 
The guys have expressed they like the bracket that was made to hold weber guns on the table. Not sure who made it but I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea to make a bunch more and get a new table to attach them to. This will enable us to store and organize our guns in the shop better. Will also reduce likelihood of damaging connectors and components while sliding them around to work on them.",,,,,"Accomplishments from weekend:

Millwrights started working on replacing the Philadelphia gearbox for roller flight #19 in the mezz around CC36, when we spun the input shaft of the rebuilt Philadelphia gearbox from our general stores, it sounded bad.  There is some backlash in the gearing on the input shaft.  The rebuilt gearbox may be worse than the current one we are running with.  We opted not to replace it.  We have 4 gearboxes in the blue tent that need to be sent out for refurbishment.  One of the gear ratios is wrong for our shop.

Hulak and other electricians working on B42 light screen upgrades.  
  
Using prints from Joe Tutwiler, pipefitters mounted brackets and rerouted the sealer hose for the robot 6X-130-4 at W26. Because of the width of the cable tray, the robot program had to be updated to have a purge location outside of the tray. A tip-calibration stand also had to be moved, and the program was updated for that new location as well.
 
The movement of the sealer hose in the tray brings it uncomfortably close to an encoder cable near the base of the robot. A sheet metal shield could guide the hose away from the cable and protect the encoder. We need to follow up with the toolmakers about the design and fabrication of the shield. Need to follow up with toolmakers about protecting the encoder cable from the sealer hose on 6X-130-4.

 ",,,,,"We finished running the last two cables for the new Leoni harness at 6X-130-04. One of the cables provided with the kit was too short. The longer version of the cable was not set up in stores, but we found one in the electrician crib. We sent the cable info to Dave Aldridge to set up for future use. We ran the 6X-130-4 robot through long and short wheelbase programs and tested the sealer system, and everything is ready to go.
 
Millwrights took an old Philadelphia gearbox from the Kolene Building and attempted to take it apart to see if we could replace the input shaft bearing on the gearbox in the mezz for roller flight #19.  It does not appear the tapered bearings we were given are correct, they are too large.  It also does not appear that replacing the bearings is something that one would want to do in place.  Top has to come off and the bearings pressed in and out.  
Inspected the encoder assemblies for the east CAL line.  Back up is Ok.  Primary had a bad wheel and bearing is going bad.   Replacing bearings and wheel.  Will not be ready to install this morning.  Josh will set it up to run off the back up encoder and we will install the repaired encoder assembly Tuesday night when we return.

5J230-1: Rivets installed upside down. Found after about 15 units. This created a cascading effect of issues. 1. Small bracket did not stay in place due to rivets not holding them causing the inner not fitting into the outer, I walked up at this time finding Hatcher and Bunt brutalizing the clamps in an effort to get them to close. I asked them to separate the part finding the piece holding it up. Removed it and ran. Inspector called me over to ask about a funny looking rivet. I agreed and locked out and found the rivets loaded upside down in the GBSD. Had that corrected and had the line fired up.  Immediately 5J210-1 faults out Head too high, skipped once, feed fault, rethreaded spool, feed fault, replaced nose switch cable, feed fault, pull off GBSD finding punch broken.

#1 – 6Y-80-10 – FDS – Step 15 max time exceeded – 16x for 43min – Started faulting on nearly all spots. EL was over there resetting and making adjustments. I drove by and he explained to me what he was doing. I told him we should check the bit. Went in and found the bit was burnt up pretty badly. Replaced bit and still had quite a few faults. Took us some time to undo the adjustments the EL had made to the burnt up bit. We stopped running soon after this so it may or not be fixed now. Monitor at start up.
 
#2 – 6X-20-06 – Head too low – 1x for 42min – TMs were originally called to deal with a rivet feed issue. They replaced feedstick and while in there they noticed the die was loose so they tightened it. Well once it started back up the die broke for some reason. When the die broke it shattered the poke yoke and lodged the post in the c-frame. TMs spent some time extracting the die and in the process stripped out the set screw so they then had to extract that. They also went back to the shop to get a new poke yoke which then was dropped in the cell and lost under a mess of cable tray/fixturing. We couldn’t find it. I had them install the die without the poke yoke to get us running while I retrieved one from stores. Was able to get 3 from stores. In order to avoid another die break we stopped the line again and installed the new poke yoke.
 
#4 – 6X-20-06 – Rivet stuck in tube – 2x for 25min – Rivet not making it to feedstick. TMs came and cleared rivet. This eventually turned into rivet not trapped faults. Feedstick was replaced and dynamic tube was cut and terminated again. Did not repeat.
 
#5 – 6X-60-04 – Step 7 max depth exceeded – 8x for 20min – Gun #1 faulting due to screw not making it to nose. Instructed EL to swap gun until we could work on it between shifts. TMs found the rigid feed tube backed out on gun #1. They took it apart and fixed it along with the jaw opening. Back on gun #1.
 
#8 – 8X-100-06 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 17min – Nose switch sticking. Called TMs and PFs to replace GBSD. No more issues.
 
#1 – 8A-100-01 – Nut not present with ram advanced – 2x for 1hr50min – When I arrive the jaw on the feed arm was broken due to the ram firing on top of it. We did not have a new jaw but the TMs were able to straighten the shoulder bolt and install it back on the tool to run. It was then the EL realized the prox that detects the nut was damaged. Took a while to locate a new prox. We found one and installed it. No further issues. Prox could have been root cause of the arm being damaged. Jaw is still damaged and will need to be replaced. Stores shows zero but I think we have some hiding somewhere….maybe? There is a pan that needs a SPAC nut repair. Do not recall what repair we are allowed to do on these.
 
#5 – 9A-40-01 – FDS – 7x for 48min – Step 4 min depth not reached – Screw hanging up in head on numerous programs. Between shifts TMs took head apart and cleaned it. Also adjusted the floating head assembly. May need further adjustment. Monitor.
 
#7 – 7B-10-01 – Ram over travel – 1x for 44min – Trap door on feed arm stuck open so nuts were falling out before being pressed resulting in the over travel. Not sure what took so long for TM help to be called but they were called and had it fixed within 5min. Cleaned and set trap door.

It was twisted and kinked. They came over and cut a new tube and installed it. Immediately still getting rivet stuck in tube faults.

Found cube for 6X60-4 disassembled and then identified we needed to move over to the correct cube. Found screw catching right at quick connect on robot side of toolchanger. Swapped over to the back up tube but it seems to be clogged so we went back to the primary and trimmed a small section off the end and it's curreny running fine. Follow up required this weekend to replace both feed tubes. 
 
6X80-3: Henrob engineers came by today to help with the die breaking issue and noticed button formation appeared tighter than expected. Upon review of our database it was determined that we were using an incorrect die DP0902200H1R1.5-9YA4 and should have been using DP1102200H1R1.5-1YA4 . Henrob engineers contacted their Joining experts and stated there is no reason for alarm and that we are within specifications for a good joint. They are however doing some testing for us. VO engineer Jared Eudier has been notified and asked for advice moving forward. He has all the pertinent information and will contact us as soon as possible. Digging through our downtime database I found that the first instance of a reported die breakage was on 16 Oct. 2018 this is corroborated with downloaded change log data that I have on a thumb drive.

Hand rail on both left and right sides of sta 130 closures 2 have been installed.   Ready for paint.   ","Snyder – C-Crew – 8/7/19
#1 – 8Y-120-04 – Feed fault – 2x for 39min – Call was made to swap GBSD. Majority of downtime was due to miscommunication resulting in PF not showing up for quite some time. Once GBSD was swapped no more issues.
 
#2/#3 – 6X-20-04 – Pusher back/Pusher not retracted – 4x for 28min – Pusher binding up in feedstick. TMs and PFs replaced feedstick.
 
#5 – 6Y-180-02 – FDS – 1x for 18min – Gun #2 didn’t last long. When I got there they were already in process of swapping to gun #1 but it wouldn’t pass an offset. Adjusted analog depth sensor. We were able to get offset and run. Gun #2 still needs follow up…I got tied up in the met lab. ELs are saying it isn’t advancing forward.
 
#2 – 7G-70-R01 – FDS – 1x for 51min – Brooks sent a few too many screws and was not sure how to recover. I couldn’t get over there for quite a while and he waited…had TMs come clear jam.
 
#4 – 5C-10-01 – Feed fault – 1x for 38min – Punch bent and got jammed in nose. TMs came and replaced punch, GBSD and nose. During this the home offset was lost so we kept getting double rivet faults. Also found rivmon was taught to some dry fires. Coached the EL, re-homed tool and then had to re-teach rivmon.
 
Spent majority of my night looking for a unit, cutting it apart, cutting the pieces further and cross sectioning.

#1 – 6X-20-02 – Pusher not retracted – 9x for 52min – Wasn’t until around lunch I found out the EL had been limping this tool along all shift. Tool faulted just before lunch so we went in and swapped out the feedstick. After lunch it ran a few jobs and faulted again. I had the TMs go and replace the nose. The insert looked twisted and you could see it was rubbing the pusher. They replaced the feedstick again while replacing the nose. No more issues rest of shift. Monitor.
 
#2 – 6X-180-03 – Feed fault – 6x for 34min – Right at beginning of shift feed faults began. Tape was chewed up bad from what appeared to be over pull. Called TMs and PFs to swap GBSD. Swap was completed. Ran for a bit but then began to fault again. I called PFs back over to turn sprocket pressure down slighy. This did not help. Called TMs again…they did not have another 154 GBSD ready. They adjusted the nose switch housing and we limped it along while they finished up the rebuild on the GBSD. Once it was done we swapped it again. No more issues.

#10 – 6X-20-06 – Escapement not at A – 1x for 13min – This has been happening for a few days on and off. Verified the escapement at A sensor was set right and functioning. It was. After production we went in and took apart the escapement cylinder to clean it. Found it wasn’t that dirty but the escapement slide had a burr on it and was grooved. TMs filed it and cleaned it up and then put it back together. Mag has been filled and verified but will still need to monitor.","#1 Main – C60PRB20 – ShiftReg Model Code still Present Fault – Says it was on for 2 hours.

#1 – 6X-20-03 – Pusher not retracted – 4x for 1hr13min – Faults carried over from previous shift. ELs were able to rest it and keep it running. One EL texted me about 8:45 and asked if we could have TMs go through it during lunch. At 9:35 I got a call on the radio saying they were waiting for TMs at 6X-20. I guess the EL meant to say break not lunch and failed to call or text me again to check to see if TMs were still coming. The line sat down for nearly an hour without anyone notifying us. I think got TMs and PFs over there to replace the feedstick. With new feedstick fault came back immediately. Went in and tried to valve the pusher and it would not budge but we could hear an air leak. Fitting for the cylinder that controls the pusher was loose which would not allow it to cycle. Once that was tightened up it ran fine without incident.
 
#4 – 6X-20-13 – Head too low – 3x for 40min – EL contacted me asking for help because he was getting Rivmon faults. Went over there and had him bring it out to the gate. Die was completely busted off. I then noticed he reset the fault over 20 times. Had Rob order a new die post immediately because I assumed this one was wrecked from the fault resets. While we were getting the new die post I had TMs come and start trying to get the die stem out of current post. They couldn’t reach the screw at its maintenance positon so the EL moved the tool to a better position. TMs were able to extract the stem and install a new die in the die post. EL sent robot in from the touched up position causing it to crash into the fencing and overhead cable tray. Had to move the robot manually to home and get it to pick back up where it left off. Immediately had double rivet faults because the EL taught Rivmon to a broken die. Took advantage of quite a few “coaching” opportunities with the ELs in that area.

#3 – 6X-20-02 – Rivet time delay exceeded – 1x for 31min – Slew of faults led to this. Basically tool lost its I/O and faulted for that. Somewhere in the recovery of that it lost the sequence of the rivet in the nose. EL was from out of area and didn’t know how to recover which led to multiple rivets being fed to the feedstick causing it to jam up. TMs came and cleared a handful of rivets and off it went.

#2 – 9C-230-01 – Profil press not advanced – 1x for 1hr12min – At end of dayshift they had an issue with a stud being smashed/stuck in the head. TMs and PFs replaced head at EOS. When we got here at 7p it still wasn’t running. The new head was not functioning properly. After an extended breakdown due to shift change/hand-off we went in and start looking at it with the A-Crew TMs. Found the previous shift PFs had plumbed the new head incorrecy…the hoses being switched was causing the issue. Once we corrected that and got it all back in sequence things took off and ran.

#1 – 6X-20-02 – Tool I/O Node Mismatch – 10x for 40min – EL kept keeping it limping by resetting. Went in a few times and checked to make sure everything was secure. No luck. Went in at lunch to take a better look. Noticed we pulling cable where it comes out of Leoni we could get the I/O to flicker on the Henrob. Re-routed and secured cable with Velcro. Faults continued…as EL was watching it from the fence he saw the D-Net cable was rubbing on the motor of the setter as it ran. Suspecting interference the EL adjusted the cable routing further to keep it away from the motor. Once he did this we had no more faults the remainder of the shift. A new D-Net cable is in the crib ready to be swapped but I think we have it resolved. I was told cable was already changed last week. Monitoring.

The faults went away to we went back in and removed the temp cable and it continued to run without faults. Nose switch still is not making like it should…GBSD has been changed 4 times in 2 weeks.

Setter was pretty loud, end distance was trending low and force was trending high. To keep them running we increased velocity hoping it would make it to lunch. It ran for a bit and then the rivets were out of spec again. Stopped the line to change the setter. TMs brought another 250072 setter over and put it on. This setter would not even calibrate because the punch was sitting too low. Brought another setter in and installed it without issue and tool ran rest of shift. TMs will need to disassemble the second setter and see if there is a piece internally missing that would cause the punch to not seat fully.
 
Cowl Dash – TOX HMIs….did we ever get the firmware upgrade or whatever? I know TOX was supposed to come check them out during shutdown.

7K-40-L05 – Feed fault – 8x for 5min – EL called and said he couldn’t get it to finish a job without faulting. Had TMs and PFs swap GBSD. No more issues.
 
6X-20 – Rivmon faults – Due to unit with bodysides off location being pushed through.
 
6Y-180-01 – I did not step through the programs on the new gun. Line ran late and both guns on 80-09 were messed up. Worked on those until 5:20am. Still needs to be verified.
 
7G-70-L01 – Did not get to follow up on this one as well. Had 2 of the TMs with me the entire time between shifts on framing respot and the other two were getting all the hemmers and date stamps done.
 
8F-130 – Broken spring in REO SPAC nut press head. Slugs not being punched out. Replaced spring. Good to go.
 
8G-400-02 – Travis Myers called and asked for some assistance. He said he was randomly getting head too low faults because the gun fired without a rivet. Tool rivets in an operator load fixture. After watching it one time you could see the GBSD was hitting a part of the fixture on its 3rd rivet spot. This caused the GBSD to hang up while the gun fired resulting in the punch pushing the rivet out onto the floor before the nose contacted the part. Between shifts Travis touched program up to correct this. He said it was hitting on 3 different spots. All are corrected now.

#4 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 2x for 22min – Step 5 max time exceeded. Broken belt. Gun pulled and swapped with one from the shop between shifts. Did not have time to step through but we put it on and ran it in auto on 3 jobs and didn’t have any issues. Instructed EL to swap if it started faulting at start up. If swapped it will need to be stepped through both LWB and SWB. FYI there are 4 guns on the table in the shop with no notes on what’s wrong with them. I haven’t pulled any guns out of the line in a long while so I can’t put information to them…makes it hard to determine what’s wrong or track issues with specific guns if we don’t know why they were pulled in the first place or where they came from. The one from tonight is red tagged with the robot and the issue.
 
#6 – 8Y-80-02 – Head too high – 7x for 19min – All faults occurred before we arrived at 7. Looked into it at lunch and saw it was only faulting on spots 3 and 33. End distance was riding the line. Adjusted nominal. No more issues.
 
#7 – 6X-20-17 – Head too high – 7x for 17min – Did not fault during our shift. Adjustments made seemed to have fixed it.
 
#10 – 6Y-150-01 – Feed fault – 2x for 15min – ELs called TMs and PFs over to swap GBSD after troubleshooting for a while. They said it may be a rivet present cable but weren’t sure. Went over and noticed the bulkhead was loose. After tightening no more issues. GBSD was fine.
 
#1 – 9B-220-01 – Feeder escapement PP not made – 2x for 2hr – First occurrence was 1hr45min. Walked in to the line being down. They said it hadn’t even started up. Both 210 and 220 were down. TMs cleared escapement and cycled it without issue. It remained down while we worked on 210.
 
#2 – 9B-210-01 – Stud not made – 3x for 1hr49min – Walked in to tool being down. Hadn’t started up since 6p. TMs had to clear 3 smashed studs from the head. It was so jammed they had to pry the head off to clear them. Once they got it all clear they couldn’t get a stud out consisteny. Ended up finding the feed tube was split right before the head. PFs had enough slack to cut and re-terminate the feed tube removing the split portion. Once everything was clear and studs were being fed properly we were able to finish the first part but then everything was out of sequence so it took a bit to get it all back going again.
 
#3 – 8G-400-02 – Abs position invalid – 17x for 1hr37min – Setter was swapped today during the day. Looking at the fault log it appears they had issues homing and calibrating but decided to leave it messed up. Kept getting Rivmon faults and home offset was drifting. Went and re-homed the tool but also noticed the tool stroke was off by 7mm. Appears they calibrated on top of a rivet which is why we kept getting the Rivmon faults. Re-calibrated the tool and it ran for a lite bit. Eventually the home offset drifted again and the tool would not re-home itself. Swapped setter to get it back going. If there is an issue homing a setter it should not be left on the tool to run at start up.
 
#6 – 9A-40-02 – FDS – 4x for 42min – A few max time faults. One of which occurred while we were working on the #3 CM setter swap.
 
#9 – 8A-120-02 – Nose switch fault/Rivmon faults – New setter from weekend. SWB wasn’t taught. Taught Rivmon for SWB but also had issues feeding a rivet. TMs and PFs swapped GBSD. No further issues.

Believe this issue was caused from the system getting a fault at the exit end of the system. I plan to look into breaking up the auto zones to alleviate this issue.
 
While on the subject of the exit end of Pallet Farm, I altered the logic to allow the lift tables to lower once they are raised and have unit on memory.

Per the most recent VOW Cell data, the #1 issue was WIDE MARGIN between EXP Liftgate to RH D-Pillar. Hobbs and I viewed the data and concluded that we are intentionally running the Liftgate Opening almost 3mm WIDER (10.5mm) than intended (8mm); therefore the margins inevitably are wider. Judging off the lack of warranty and the visual look of things, we decided to widen the VOW Cell specs to 6.0mm max margin from 5.5mm max margin: this should eliminate 75% of the rejects per the las 371 data points.
 
We also made a shift in the EXP liftgates 0.5mm towards the RIGHT (passenger) side of the vehicle to even out the margins on both sides.
 
  
9/20/2019 @ 9:00am Closures Liftgate Hang Perceptron SWB & LWB EXP REAR RIGHT 0.5mm BSR #  Lowe / Hobbs Moved ALL EXP Liftgates towards the RH (passenger) Side of the cab in the y-axis 0.5mm via Perceptron controls in Cell Maintenance to reduce #1 VOW Cell concern of EXP liftgates TOO WIDE to RH D-pillar per data and measurements 
 
 
 
The #2 issue on VOW Cell is FLUSHNESS to LOW between the Hood and Center of LH Fender. I’ve taken some measurements using my dial indicator gage and although I’m sure I’m not using the same datum as the VOW Cell, I am getting almost 1.0mm difference in readings. Over the weekend, I will use a Laser gage to get more reliable and accurate data, but from the looks of the hood to fender, the flushness looks great on units the VOW Cell is rejecting. After compiling the data from the laser gage, I’m sure we’re going to see a sizeable difference in the actual readings vs VOW Cell readings and will eventually make an offset to alleviate these concerns.
 
More than likely, I will make a shift on the Liftgate Hang Perceptron for SWB NAVs: the LH side of SWB NAV liftgates are consistently running about 1.0mm higher than its mating LH D-pillar shoulder. I’ll eventually make a 0.5mm shift DOWNWARD on the LH side ONLY to start and monitor the change over the next couple of weeks.

Biggest issue found was that the chain needed to be shorted on both LH and RH body side delivery conveyors.  He also identified a chain guide that needs to be replaced on the RH conveyor but there was none on hand.  Rush ordered 6 feet on REQ# 965388 and asked Aldridge to check safety stock level to ensure we have this material on hand at all times.  Also ordered more master links.
 
6Y-230 is now programmed to automatically do a full temp comp if it rejects 3 units in a row.  If the unit fails again after the temp comp the PanelView message will display a FB indicating to contact the dimensional engineer.  Testing this programming resulted in units 4509 - 4516 being tagged as suspect by 6Y-230 but they are good units.

CAL 1 VOW update:
 The sensor is back ‘close’ to the original position using match marks. We confirmed that the sensor does still fire.  We ran the calibration program on the robot and confirmed there was no damage to the robot sensor.  Tim checked the DCS for the robot and confirmed that the robot CAN get to the sensor in teach mode, so we suspect that is how this happened (without having been here), so we plan to fix that once we get the cell running again to protect these sensors.
 
We have been able to speak with one of the engineers from perceptron and he is looking into the recovery for us. At this point he suspects we will have to build a new algorithm for the visual fixture which will require touch ups to the robot programs, which I believe will require us to get Perceptron in house, but he is still investigating with the engineers who installed the cell.
 
Ultimately the station will be in bypass tonight and tomorrow while we work to resolve all this. I’ll send that info to the CAL team. ",,,,,235,7,,235,8.2,,235,7.4,,,,,,,,,"Parts:

This was the unit we had AVS issues with at Framer. Leo said that the crossmember that was installed was out of place. They backed up the robot then placed the crossmember in the proper place then went back to auto.
 
#4 Main - S050PRB 107 3PE SWB PP Skid Still On Fault. This was the result of the AVS problems we had throughout the shop. There was a LWB unit in the 6S-20-R1 end effector and a short skid in S050PRB. Got Millwrights to dismantle the skid and remove from the system. Let the remaining skids filter in then corrected the AVS data at Skid Load.","Had multiple AVS issues throughout the shop with rotation 4703 - 4708. The issue started at Underbody Main when AVS did not increment correctly for rotation 4703 after a robot collision detect fault.
 
The next occurrence was at C02LT05. The lift table would not lower due to the AVS data being verified as ""bad"". Bypassed the unit and fixed the sequence on the BUPORN AVS PanelView. Production did a swap after 4705 was released.
 
The next occurrence was at S010, S020, S030, S040 on Framer. Rotations were out of order 4707, 4705, 4706, 4708 respectively. Verified that the units were correct per the build sheet and manually adjusted the SR data to get everything back in sequence.
 
The next occurrence was at C06/Pallet to Skid. Worked with Bert Collins to get everything running at the inspection stations. The ultimate issue was at skid load where he bypassed AVS for 15 minutes without alerting anyone.

#6 – 6Y-90-03 – Feed fault – 2x for 22min – ELs called for TM and PF to swap GBSD. Did not fix it. Ended up finding the nose switch cable was shorting out. New cable installed. No more issues. Explained to the ELs that although we swap GBSDs frequeny they need to do their part and trouble shoot that wire while they are waiting for support. Would have saved us quite a bit of time.
 
#8 – 6Y-180-03 – Step 15 max time – 3x for 14min – Had a few strip outs. No real repeat offenders. No changes made.
 
#10 – 6X-20-11 – Nose switch fault – 6x for 13min – Nose switch stuck on. EL kept resetting which resulted in dry fires/units repaired. Explained that nose switch faults can’t just be reset. TMs and PFs came and swapped GBSD and nose. No further issues.
 
#3 – 9B-245-01 – Clinch nut escapement not extended – 11x for 2hr – Cylinder not advancing/feeding nut. TMs called and they cleaned escapement up. Did not fix issues. They went out to the head to verify there was no jam. Cleared nuts out to ensure it wasn’t stuck there. PFs called to go through cylinder. Ended up finding it would not move into position no matter what was done. Began looking for cylinder and couldn’t find one. TMs disassembled and metal shavings came out so we knew it needed to be replaced. Fat finger in communication of part number led to a bit of confusion. Went to 558 and grab a cylinder that had a part number that was only 1 character off and brought it over anyway. Ended up matching the cylinder needing replaced. Swapped cylinder. Still didn’t run. Had a jam at the head. TMs cleared jam at head and then we were able to run parts without issue. New cylinders will be ordered so we have them on hand. SMC part # CDQ2A32-40DZ.

Paint Adhesive Squeeze Out Complaints – Being down on dash did not have chance to arrange units for touch up. Looking at units at T23 both LWB and SWB have opportunity on the door openings. Some have squeeze out concerns between the bodyside inner and outer which would be addressed in 7X-10. Some have squeeze out concerns on door openings between the bodyside and UB side sill which would be addressed in 6W-20. Below are areas I noted but it would be best to stand at T23 and check a few units to get a clear understanding. I think the issue has spiked up due to an issue with the bodyside outer to inner fit. Not sure if it has changed but you can visibly see the flange on the outer is shorter than the inner which causes the squeeze out to come through. Leaving bodysides all looks good but when it is married to the UB and ran through respot it squeezes out. T23 is best place to check.

#1 – 6X-180-02 – Collision detect – 2x for 1hr9min – Robot bypassed starting rotation 5580 and ending last bad 5682 (first good 5683) – Henrob gun ran into the windshield opening of unit. ELs called me over because they said it was “way off.” While I was on my way Leo Mejias began investigating and found that 4 of the 6 bolts that hold to Henrob gun to the faceplate of joint 6 were missing. We found 2 of the 4 bolts sheared off on the floor. At this point we sent production on early lunch. Leo taught the robot down to the ground by the access gate, locked out robot so the TMs were able to begin the process of removing the gun off the robot and transferring it to a cart. In the process of removing the gun we realized 1 of the 2 bolts holding it was broken as well and the last one was nearly sheared through. The 2 dowel pins were also backed out/broken. With everything locked out the ELs disconnected all electrical, PFs removed air and plugged the hose and then the TMs began removing the gun and securing it on a cart. With the gun off the robot and the air hose plugged we were able to move the robot back to its minor maintenance position where it stayed in bypass the remainder of the shift. At EOS TMs removed the broken bolts from the robot and mounted the gun back to the robot. ELs connected cables and PFs put air back on the tool. We verified everything was in position and able to run on a few units without issues. The sister tool 6X-180-01 was inspected for broken bolts and nothing was found. Robot and gun are good to go. There should be no more units needing containment at start-up.

-Ensured Door Fitters had and were using gauges due to VOW cell still being down. Got more tools for LVC to use to measure vehicles.
 
- I was called over to the P558_Framer Perceptron. There was a communication fault on the Perceptron. The electrician said this will happen sometimes when the line drops into auto. I had them hard restart the Perceptron and that seemed to make it work. 
 
-There were concerns from a supervisor about the reject points on the measurement monitor that was pulled up at the P558_Perceptron Station. Most of the vehicles on Cell Monitor were “rejects” because of a couple of points that are rejecting every time. Based off of what I saw, those few points that were rejecting every time were due to the Perceptron having trouble reading these specific points.
 
- They were having problems tonight with the Hood Hinge/Hydroform at CC34. The issue is the lower hole on the outside of the Hydroform on the RH side. This is the only hole that they are having issues with. The operator said that he would have a few in a row that were good and then a few in a row that were overshadowed. I went over to where the hydroform is put on and the alignment looked perfect. After it goes through the framing gate there is a place to look at it again and I noticed that those same holes from before the framing gate that looked good were now overshadowed. From what I was seeing, the problem is when it goes through the framing gate. ",,,,,,,,,,,

Night shift started experiencing issues with the RH Cowl Side bolt secure on Closure 1 and had to input containment due to over shadow from the hydroform tube. Started investigation and discovered there were multiple issues:
 
1. The nut on the Cowl Side is running 1.5 mm forward and Low (data in attachments). This is done in P558. I contacted Dave Fletcher and they made an adjustment to the nut position to bring it to zero. I will complete a follow up measurement tomorrow to verify the nuts are back in the correct position.
2. The RH Hydroform tube made a 1.0 mm upward shift yesterday during production. (data attached in powerpoint) This could be seen in the CMM data along with Perceptron (although the shift was not enough to throw a reject alarm). I went in the framer and found that the 4 way pin for the hydroform tube was bent. We removed the detail and the dowels were fine, and when we reinstalled it the pin was straight. 
 
This is the second time we've had damage to our hydroform tube pins in the last year causing the tube positions to shift. I believe the cause of this is that there are no wipers on the gates (like there were on the 473/22X gates) to guide the tubes onto the pins, so we are putting a lot of pressure on the pins when the gates advance. I am working on designing some wipers to install in the station that will hopefully take some stress off the pins",,,,,,,,,,,

-I was called over to the RH Box Outer. There were having trouble running the 6’s during the day so they were just running 8’s when I went over. The actual issue was the pin clamp was tight going into the locating hole (4 way).  I was told that they had changed the pin clamp shortly before I got there. They also changed out the solenoid valve. When they changed the pin clamp they put a C6075 pin clamp where on the LH Box Outer there was a C6074 pin clamp. So they changed it again to a C6074 to match what was on the LH Box Outer line and there were no issues after that.

#1 – 6X-20-02 – Tool I/O Node Mismatch – 2x for 52min – Began getting I/O node mismatch faults that could not be reset. At lunch we ran a new d-net cable from the tool external of the Leoni to J3. Fault was able to be reset so we assumed we were good to go. When we started up after lunch the faults came back. After investigating further we found we could control the fault by moving a small 5-pin cable that ran from a splitter to the valve manifold on the magazine assembly plate. We found what appeared to be a used cable in the lineside cabinet and installed it in hopes of clearing the fault. This did not work. Looked around for a cable with no luck. Found some in GS and purchased 3 of them. We installed a new cable and the faults went away for the remainder of the shift. The long d-net cable is still strung outside of the Leoni. I’d say if we run today without issue it can be removed and placed back in the lineside cabinet. Both LH and RH framer now have one of the short 5-pin cables in their lineside cabinet.

When we got over there the panel view was showing a “head not back” fault for the Henrob on 10-02. Henrob showed home and its I/O showed the same. Did some digging in the logic trying to figure out why the robot was getting “failed to run task.” After a while with no luck and a few cycle powers we stumbled on the “rivet 1” being turned off in the robot general IF menu. Once we turned it back on the issues went away and we ran. With “rivet 1” turned off the robot was looking for a second gun.

No speck. Sat and T23 for an hour…no speck. Checked closure 1…no speck. Checked closure 2. You guessed it…no speck. Either I am looking at the wrong thing, I am blind or it magically went away. Can’t find it.
 
6Y-180-03 – Wouldn’t return from retracted position. Stuck staying up. Swapped to finish shift. Between shifts PM’d it and found the jam nut for the hold down pressure was backed off so it had no air to return the head. Adjusted pressure and had no more issues.

#3 – 6X-160-02 – Feed fault – 2x for 25min – ELs called because tape wouldn’t feed. Called TMs and PFs to swap GBSD. TMs adjusted the nose switch housing which didn’t work and then they swapped GBSD.
 
8Y-110-03 – Buttons look like absolute trash. Between shifts I had the Super Dahl Bros check and mess with alignment on it. Check units in the AM to see if it got any better. I was told we had this issue before and it was fixed on days. I cannot recall what we did. I checked the die and you can clearly see it is not worn on about 30% of the die. McClure states he already went through robot program and made sure it was against the metal and not at an awkward angle.
 
#2 – 5B-50-03 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 44min – Punch broke off inside the nose. Took some effort to beat the GBSD off due to the sheared punch. Replaced punch, GBSD and nose. After this we began having double rivet faults due to the home offset being off from the punch change. Re-homed the tool successfully and ran well the rest of shift.
 
#3 – 9A-20-01 – Lock pin not extended – 1x for 30min – Pin on the horizontal nut press was not reached extended position. EL was not from area and unfamiliar with the tool. After some poking around we realized the pin was not reaching position because slug was attached to the hold in the hydroform which was stopping the pin from reaching its position. We backed the robot out of the tool and removed the slug and it took off without issue the rest of shift.
 
#5 – 9B-245-01 – Clinch nut escapement not extended – 2x for 19min – Nuts jammed in escapement. TMs came and disassembled, cleaned and oiled. No more issues. Operators/inspectors reported slugs still on the nuts but they were all passing torque checks. We did not make any adjustments to the tooling. I think alignment may be off. We went in and there is up and down play on the linear bearing rail of the tool.
 
Front Door – Around 9:45p I got a call that hem adhesive was off location on a torn down door. When I got there I realized it wasn’t just off location it was either completely missing or so far off location it was not even close to the hem. Went in and immediately noticed the nozzle was broken off the ped. I asked if they had just switched models and was told they had ran 80 doors of that model. Looking at the racks of doors built every single door had a glob of hem adhesive on the inner which indicated the nozzle was broken. The ELs then informed me that they had a crash due to a damaged outer making its way in the cell at 7:30p. We are confident that this is when the nozzle was broken so we went back and checked the previous model of doors ran and found a few racks of those bad as well. Inspector is supposed to check the first door off the line when model change occurs. She failed to do this which resulted in us building over 80 bad doors. She is also to check her adhesive visually while line is running once per hour. This also could not have been done. Production is all lined up with the facts/data/ammunition. Tony Redd said they will be talking with inspector tonight. I will line David Sidorowicz up as well.

5J-200-02 – 553 adhesive work – As I was walking in I got the call to come to 200-02. Inspector was identifying area at beginning of adhesive path where it was very thin. The area was not large and not a show stopped but we had PFs come over and adjust pre-pressure to try and get more volume at beginning of bead. This seemed to help slighy. We also slowed down the robot moves during that part of the path which seemed to help the most. Ran for a lite bit and then I got a call back saying it looked worse. The thin spot was back and now we had some stringers and a loop getting on the class A surface. We stopped the line and stepped the robot through the path. You could clearly see the path needed some work. The nozzle was moving up and down away from the part in numerous areas. There was also a point that moved down away from the flange when it should not have. We adjusted numerous points of the program and the first few parts showed some improvement in some areas while others still needed adjustment. It appeared we taught it too close on some spots so we backed them off. After this the parts looked good and the inspector kept checking with no further issues noted.",,,,,"Drew and Gary made another adjustment on the catwalk bolt on 190R04 on closure 2.

5J200-2: Came in to find the lincoln liftgates running but not covering more than 60%, stopped the line and started working on the program. Was able to get Phil Risinger to come over and he cleared up a lot of the open questions we had concerning how things talked to each other. After revieiwing all of our data he determined that we needed to up our pre-pressure. This did not help and by the time we determined this we had run out of Lincoln parts and had to switch to Ford Models. Ford program proved out that we did not have an obstruction in the line. Set up to have 10 Lincoln parts ready to load into the line for program touch up. Bryan Wolf is working on this. 
 
9A40-2: Multiple issues. Walked up to find it faulted with an error I have not seen before.""Too many screws in system"". Called toolmakers who found 2 screws stuck at the brake. Cleared and after homing the spindle we were able to start running. Changes were made to program 2 step 7 to get it running. The data indicated we were missing the clearance hole and the screw was sitting up 2mm. This got it running and the plan was to touch up the program at the end of the shift. We ran out of parts for the remainder of the day and could not get this done.

Cook and Heissenbuttel worked on robot rebuild for P558. Had to contact the Maintenance Process Coach in 558 and use all my charm to get a Toolmaker to replace Ken so I could do maintenance.
Marty worked with John Mangis and the Underbody apprentice on proper Weber programming techniques so we could touch up all the programs on 8Y10-5 and 8Y10-6

#4 – 8X-100-06 – Feed fault – 4x for 50min – 4D attached. Walked into issue. They were about to put on the THIRD GBSD. TMs also had already stoned the punch to remove a burr they saw. Third GBSD was already being installed so I let them finish. Still were getting feed faults immediately. Went into the cell to check it out and noticed right away the rivet present cable was mangled. Had small discussion with the EL about actually troubleshooting the problem instead of just throwing parts at it. Cable could have been identified immediately if it was looked at or wiggled. Swapped rivet present cable and did not have any other issues the rest of the shift.
 
#8 – 8Y-10-05 – TC1 PP still made – 2x for 30min – 4D attached. Both guns in station 10 did not start up well after program touch ups. Went to swap them both to gun #1 and they both locked up during the tool change program. Could not really find what was going on so we manually stepped them through the process and were able to run. After looking into the robot program edits it appears both tool change programs were edited this weekend. No clue who or why but they were…maybe Marty knows?
 
#9 – 6Y-80-08 – Pin returned not made – 5x for 23min – ELs called for TMs saying the pin wouldn’t return because it was dirty. TMs came and cleaned. Issue was still present. EL then said it was due to it binding on the part. I asked if they had tried to manually valve the pin to see if it indeed was bound on the part. They had not…we went in and valved it and it moved as free as a bird. I then inquired as to what tells us if the pin is retracted…oh the prox. Checked and it was indeed so loose it was just sliding all around the bracket. Once prox was set and tightened issue went away. PHEW!
 
#10 – 6Y-80-09 – FDS – 7x for 22min – Getting a strange fault on program 4 for step 5 max time exceeded. Only that one program…generally this is a bad belt or transducer. Transducer checked fine and belt did as well. Swapped to gun #1 to see if it followed and it did not. Between shifts we cleaned the ATI pins and ELs wanted to swap transducer cable so we did that. Will monitor at start up.
 
8Y-10-06 – On gun #1. Needs touched up. Programs not centered in clearance holes on back. Dropped the ball on staging jobs to get it done tonight. Sorry.
8Y-10-05 – May need touched up. But the bit was also shot on it at start up. Put new bit in and put it back on gun #2. See if it starts up alright with the new bit.
7K-40-R02 – On gun #1. Has been since last week. I didn’t get a chance to get to it tonight. Will try to work on it today. Only faulting on one spot. Most likely can be resolved with touch up or parameter adjustments.
7G-50-R01 – On gun #1. Not sure when or why this one swapped. Just noticed it at end of shift. Will try to see what’s going on with it tonight.","Main #1 - #4 – POC faults on LH BS Outer – Combination of new driver and dirty PP switches. Cleaned PP switches.

8Y10-5: Min depth not reached program 17 step 15 x17, verified screw was fully down and seated then adjusted depth parameter to -2.2mm then copied program positional data over from LWB to SWB program. Will monitor at start up. Toolchange programs compared to find issues encountered last night. Found TC Lock DI 633 and TC Unlock DI 634 both set to ON in verify program on both robots to be root cause of toolchange program failures last night. Fat fingers appear to be the root cause although no one really wants to own it. 
 
8Y10-6: Min depth not reached program 14 step 14. Analog depth reading at -20 all the way to -32.4, went in to look at screw on next fault and found a screw in the hole at an estimated depth of -20 and another screw in the jaws attempting to drive into the screw head. Not sure how this happened, I was there the entire time and nobody touched the controller. PM'd gun at lunch and faults have tapered off. 
 
7X20R-3: Feed faults. Swapped GBSD. 2 hours later faults reoccurred, inspected tape and found it under pulling and air pressure at 38psi. Adjusted to 41psi and faults cleared up. 
 
5J240-3: Hem adhesive smeared around lower RH Ford window opening on outer panel from part present switch mounted too close to part. Found bracket had two sets of holes for mounting so I had it slotted between shifts and moved back a bit to stay out of the adhesive.

#3 – 8X-40-02 – Feed fault – 5x for 35min – First occurrence the ELs were with me on rear ladder and we did not see the line was done for about 10min. They were able to reset it but it eventually came back. TMs and PFs were called to swap GBSD. No more issues.
 
#5 – 8Y-10-05 – Step 15 min depth not reached – 14x for 22min – Still seeing the min depth faults on program 17 as noted from dayshift. We were not meeting the opened up -2.0mm depth. Inspectors still said the screw was seated. We stopped the line briefly to touch up that one spot on both models. With bringing the gun closer to the part we were able to hit a depth of -0.5-0.7mm consisteny and eliminate the faults completely. Great work on both guns today…they ran very well!
 
#9 – 8Y-30-04 – Feed fault – 5x for 12min – EL kept resetting fault to keep line moving. Tape was getting chewed up pretty bad. Just before lunch we had TMs and PFs come swap GBSD. No more issues rest of shift.
 
#4 – 8F-125-01 – Head too high – 6x for 34min – Still having issues with buttons breaking of steel bracket. Production has been setting stock aside to try and figure out if it is an issue with specific lots/dates. We changed the spool of rivets to a different batch and it seemed to help slighy but did not clear up faults completely. With the issue with the brackets I would lean towards that being the root cause. In the mean time I told the ELs to keep sending units as suspect and had the inspector ready to check with adhesive tape to put over the broken buttons.

6X-180-04 – Feed Fault – EL noticed an air leak on a hose connecting into the GBSD. I called PF to scene and had him re-install airline properly into GBSD.
 
6X-140-02 – Feed Fault – Tape visually appeared to not be under or over pulling. Air pressure was set properly. TM’s swapped GBSD.
 
6X-180-04 – Head too low – Rivmon graphs were off the charts indicating a mechanical problem. EL noticed there was no die on the tool when it was brought to fence. Die was found on the ground sheared in half. TM’s replaced poke yoke and die. Tool faulted and was fixed on same job. Unit was marked as suspect for repair.
 
6X-170-02 – Feed Fault – Tape was destroyed, couldn’t remove rivet tape through due to a rivet being lodged inside of gbsd. TM’s swapped GBSD.
 
6X-190-05 – Head too low – EL nominalized problematic spot locations in rivmon.
 
Subs
9A-20-01B – escapement not advanced – Tool was receiving this fault due to a spac nut part present sensor not being made inside of the cell on the REO press. The feeder keeps trying to send nuts until part present is made. Tube gets so filled with spac nuts that the escapement can’t advance fully. TM’s adjusted hard stops on vertical placement arm so it would sit more flush with the feed tube and incoming spac nuts would ride along the bottom edge where the PP sensor is located.

Ron came up with a genius numbering system that gives all the information needed to control which ladder is where and where it belongs. The location of ladders fell on Joe to distribute and have ladders readily available for breakdowns and repairs. The two together implemented a tile tracking system that allows safety inspections to locate and monitor the ladders on the floor.

Matt Daniel notified me of a broken die in their dash cell on 558 side from robot 150-02. They provide us with these dash panels that we load into our Cowl Dash line. He did not have a start time for when this broken die occurred but he told me that they sent a few racks to our side of the shop earlier today. We found a rack near Column L23 with the suspect rivets on the dash panel, I had an inspector check the suspect rivets along with doing a tear down and everything checked out good.

#3 – 6Y-90-07 – Head too low – 4x for 27min – End distance suddenly spiked out of tolerance. ELs called me over because it was faulting every rivet. Home offset hadn’t drifted much but we re-homed it successfully. I went in and checked the rivets and they looked and measured fine so I had the ELs put Rivmon into teach 100. I also went and notified the inspector to check all jobs as they pass through T23. After teach 100 ran out we started faulting again. Rivets now were sitting very high (about half inserted). Setter wouldn’t retract or home. Taught robot to maintenance and the TMs replaced the setter it was on its last rebuild before its 4M cycle and had 221k cycles on it. Checked forward and did not find any jobs with bad rivets so containment was not needed. No issues after new setter and Rivmon teaching.
 
#5 – 6X-90-05 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 17min – EL said he had two instances of nose switch fault. Went over and removed tape from the nose and the switch stayed on. Looking into the nose you could see the switch was stuck in the up position. We toggled it with a  screw driver and it returned to its normal position but TMs were already on the way to swap it. Thinking in cases like this we could test a graphite lube or alcohol to spray on the switch to free it up. GBSD had 226k cycles on it and I believe it could have continued to run with a bit of love on the switch. New GBSD runs fine so that tells me the punch didn’t cause damage to the switch itself.
 
#6 – 6Y-90-07 – Time delay exceeded – 1x for 16min – This fault occurred when the setter would not retract and eventually timed the robot out.
 
#1 – 9C-220-01 – Multi stud still made – 20x for 38min – Getting faults for multiple studs but there was only one stud out there. EL Paul Carrol was able to resolve the issue by adjusting the switch that signals this fault. It was reading part of the tool.
 
#7 – 9A-40-01 – FDS – 1x for 16min – FDS fault that led to one too many screws being fed to the gun. TMs had to come and clear out the jam.
 
#8 – 5A-20-01 – Head too low – 1x for 16min – Die broke off at the stem and poke yoke took some extensive damage as well. We did not have one to spare, 558 does not have one, stores shows zero. 4 on order. Tried to locate a spring clip to use in the meantime but had no luck. We curreny do not have a safety stock on die poke yokes. I am working on a poke yoke/K-19 cross reference sheet that I will send to our stores friends.

-At Lift Gate 5J-210 (where the lower outer and the upper outer come together) the lower outer in the 2nd hole (2 way) from the left is getting bent some because there is not a lot of room when the pin goes in. This is happening in fixture A and fixture D. They have this in trim but it is not causing problems. I found someone with access to team center and we found that the hole should be 12 mm in height which is what it is measured at. Knowing this, the robot that puts this piece into the fixture would just need the program for the drop-off adjusted. The number for the lift gate lower outer is “JL1B7840404AF”.

Spoke with Rick from Tox, he will be making a visit to try and correct this ongoing issue.

Worked on 6X-60-01 Gun 1 in-between shifts with John and Steve. Tool was acting very odd, at home it would pass its friction test, but while in a job the tool would fail its friction test.

 - Added 0.5mm to the LWB NAV 4-way Pin and 2-way at the RH Front Door Hinge Set to move the LWB NAV front doors fore due to fit concerns, Vow Cell data, and LVC concerns. This should fix the tight door to door margins that we are seeing at LVC. This can potentially be moved more but I wanted to be able to see how they were coming into the pre fit station before it was shimmed more. 
 
- LVC had some RH front doors that the hinges were bent from the doors being flexed too much by fitters. I spoke to the chassis and VOW cell fitters to make sure they were not flexing the doors too much. 
 
- Pallet 0887 rejected by -14mm and it was ran through again to see if it was just a bad read and it read +10mm. This pallet has been consistently misreading on U102_RH_Pad so it was wiped off and it read good. I’ll be checking this pallet the next time it runs through to see if it continues to get good readings.  
 
- Found in WDBM that the links for VOW cell data are saying they are updating but when you zoom in on the charts the actual data in the graphs is not updating (it shows the date for each point). 
 
- We had a couple more of the hoods that are dented when they are closed due to the latch being closed. The fitters were notified of this problem so they know to look for it. They were repaired by EOL and like Chris Lowe said in the night letter a few days ago the CMA suppliers have been contacted about this issue.

- Paint has had an issue with the RH front door clips not keeping the doors closed in paint. They said they had about 10 this shift and that it is LWB, SWB, Nav & Exp. I went and I checked where these clips are put on and then I checked every door between there and paint and we did not have that issue on any of those.

6Y180-1: It all started with a broken bit on gun 1. Swapped to gun 2 and struggled to keep it running with several different faults related to the screw getting to the jaw. Limped it along until lunch. Swapped back to gun 1 and put a new bit and head assembly on it, ran one full truck then halfway through the next and it would not put a screw in the cowl top. Finally brought it out to the maintenance area after ejecting 5 or so screws and attempted to run the spindle in manual. Nothing. Broken belt. Put gun 2 back on the robot and freshened it up. Sent it in and had the same problems as we did earlier with the screws hanging up at -27mm, -44mm and -59mm. Struggled through until we got 225 through pallet to skid then swapped both guns with rebuilt spares from the shop.
 
7K40R-4: Gun 1 depth adjustments requested from inspector on spots 31, 32, 33 and 34. Velocities reduced by 20 mm/sec. Many, many speed faults before I got over there and taught them as good.

#1 – 7K-40-R08 – Weber tebacle – 2hrs – When I came in at 7p I was informed RHBS had not run a single unit due to a Weber being down. They said that neither gun would work and it would not complete an eject sequence. By the time I got there they had already temped a signal cable bypassing the IGUS with no luck. I then attempted to have them adjust and set the analog depth sensor to make it run. When adjusting it the values were jumping all over the place. At this point we installed a jumper signal cable from the gun to the robot in order to rule out the ATI. Attempted to adjust sensor again and saw the same issues. We then took the temp cable and ran it from the gun all the way to the Weber controller direcy. This would rule out ANY cable in the system. Same issues. At this point we tried a completely new analog depth sensor…no luck. We located the prints and traced the analog depth sensor wire back to the WSP2 module inside the controller. It is rare for these to fail but it was the only thing left. Satterwhite was able to locate one and we were able to successfully swap it out and install the old memory card retaining all of our settings and programming information. With the new WSP2 we were able to successfully set the analog depth sensor to rear its advanced position. Once it was set the tool was able to run without any issues. Only work done in the area over the weekend was robot lubrication which should not have caused us any issues like this.
 
#5 – 6X-60-02 – Step 15 max time exceeded – 11x for 33min – Els stated gun #1 was constany faulting for step 15 strip out. They switched to gun #2 to keep the line running. Gun #2 was running just as bad. TMs came over at end of shift and replaced both bits as they were both blue and rounded out. ELs are working on touching up programs on gun #2 right now just so we can get one of the guns running. Gun #1 will need to be touched up and fixed by dayshift at EOS.
 
#1 – 5B-30-03 – Sealer doser not filled – 2x for 2hr25min – Purple adhesive change over did not go well. There was quite a bit of downtime while we were down on bodysides but when I got over there it was still down. I was told they spent quite a bit of time purging the system trying to get the old 410A material out of the system and adjusting settings to get it to stop oozing out inconsisteny. The adhesive was just running out of the nozzle non-stop and every single door we were building was scrap. I stopped the line until we could get it fixed. At this point Eric Rossignol replaced the dispense valve which seemed to stop the non-stop leak and allow us to apply the bead as needed. I was told they had to mess with temperatures so I am not sure if some old 410A had hardened in the valve or what…after new valve was installed the doors looked better. Upon teardown we had a few thin spots so we increased the seal schedule volume from the teach pendant. The bead looked better after this and was bought off by inspectors. Probably need a lite better plan and execution for material changes next time.
 
#3 – 7G-70-L01 – Step 15 max time – 15x for 52min – Strip outs on program 7. EL checked robot program and found it was off and rubbing the clearance hole. He touched it up but still had issues. Found the bit was blue and rounded out. Replaced bit which helped slighy. Still some issues.

#2 – 7K-40-R02 – FDS – 18x for 31min – Started shift with a bunch of strip outs. Changed the bit and it seemed to help slighy but still getting faults on program 15 and 20. Then we had an issue with BT3 faults which ended up in about 7 screws being fed out to the gun and getting stuck in the tube. Called PF to come clear screws from tube. Then we began getting BT2 faults. PF found kink in tube where screws were getting hung up so we swapped to the back-up tube which seemed to run well. Still seeing strip outs so EL swapped guns to finish shift. Touching up programs now. Monitor. Work order A97904507 written for new tube this weekend and TMs made a tool for the PFs so they can head the tube and try to repair kinks. We will see how it works.

#7 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 16x for 29min – Strip outs on a select few programs. Made adjustments incrementally as it faulted. Essentially made gun #2 programs match gun #1. Seemed to have helped but we were making changes up to the last 20-30min of production so still need to monitor.
 
#8 – 7K-40-R – Clamp not closed – 8x for 24min – Was informed by Mark Smith they keep having issues with clamp closing on the roof rail. Coincidentally we are having issues with the FDS there. Going to keep an eye on it and get photos when clamp faults again.
 
6X-90-05 – Nose switch fault – 1x for 25min – Originally the GBSD fell off the tool. ELs reset it a few times I believe which damaged the punch. The TMs came and re-installed the existing GBSD but it faulted direcy after. They then came and swapped GBSD but then we were getting head too low faults with end distance off the charts. Went in the cell and found the punch laying on the unit. I am pretty sure the punch fractured or broke when the original GBSD first fell off and then when we put a new GBSD on and ran it the punch broke completely off. Replaced punch and re-homed setter and it ran.
 
7K-40-R02 – ELs were getting strip out faults and we were behind in the conveyor due to start up so they swapped to gun #1. Between shifts we found the bit worn on gun #2. Looking at the FDS schedules on the programs we were faulting on (15 and 21) the original torque settings were nearly 3nm higher than the original torque the tool was installed with. Which then was causing us to continue to try and torque a screw that was fully seated…thus eating up the bit and stripping the joint out. Dropped the torque 1.5nm down to 7nm and put gun back online. Will monitor. I gave EL clearance to drop torque down to 6nm (original torque) if it keeps faulting.

6Y-180-01 – Retracted not left – Tool was getting stuck in the retracted position when trying to eject a screw. EL verified that the sensor that reads the tool is in the eject state was functioning, and it was. Called TM over to clean and inspect the jaw assembly of the gun, didn’t appear to be any issues. TM then greased and re-aligned the linear bearings. EL tried to use the eject screw function again and we received the same fault. Next we looked at the flow control on the top of the gun, this was reading 3.5 which is low. Turns out the jam nut on flow control was loose, I had PF turn up flow control to 4.5 along with tightening the jam nut and our eject issue went away.

#4 – 6X-20-04 – Rivet not escaped – 1x for 24min – EL threw up the white flag. Appears he was struggling with it for about 10min before he called. No rivet was getting to the nose. TMs came and removed feedstick and a rivet fell out. We cycled the escapement to ensure it was moving freely and it was. Magazine is on its side at maintenance so we couldn’t really feed one out manually. Sent it back in and got the same fault. We then brought it back out and hand loaded some rivets in the magazine.

The fault was error code 6 which said Mains phase failure. It happened about 10 times from the start of shift to break. We were able to reset it to get it running. Ordered a new motor and replaced it at break. One issue that happened was the Q number and tag on the old motor matched the new motor exactly. When we went to put the new motor on the key way was to small. Had to swap the old gearbox onto the new motor to mount it. After it was replaced no more faults the rest of the night.

#1 – 6X-190-05 – Head too high – 8x for 33min – EL called and said setter was making noise and faulting. Went over and found end distance trending low and force trending high. Setter was on its way out the door. Home offset had drifted. All TMs were busy on calls so we kept resetting it and kept it running until they got there. Rivets were good but offset was changing again and end distance was getting worse so we stopped it and brought it to the gate. TMs came and changed the setter. No more issues. Setter changed was only at 80k cycles but it was on its last rebuild so it will go out to Henrob for 4M rebuild.
 
#2 – 8Y-10-05 – FDS – 16x for 31min – Day shift had 3 faults for 7min. We were getting a lot of min depth not reached faults. Inspectors let us know that all the suspect screws were seated fully. We began going in and checking each as they faulted and they were all seated but the heads were chewed up indicating it was trying to drive further when already seated. We adjusted torque on 2 programs and then adjusted robot position up away from the part on 2 spots. Appeared it was programmed too close not allowing the tool to fully stroke to its set depth. Had 4 faults after changes which was better than the 12 before…still monitoring. Past few days both 10-05 and 06 ran very well and all the sudden things went really south tonight. Not sure what happened.
 
#3 – 8Y-10-06 – FDS – 11x for 25min – Day shift had 9 faults for 20min. We were seeing strip outs mainly on numerous programs. Bit was rounded out slighy so we swapped it. Noticed bit was really hot and could see brass dust all over the tool indicating the bushing was wearing…most likely due to programming being off center. Shift note did not indicate any touch ups but EL said dayshift EL told them they did. We replaced bit and adjusted torque and depth on some spots. The screw heads were chewed up and the screw was seated which indicates it was trying to drive further when already seated. After changes we had 3 faults compared to 8 in the first 3 hours of the shift. Still monitoring.
 
#5 – 6Y-110-01 – FDS – 8x for 17min – ELs called saying they needed a bit. We got over there and noticed transducer cable was loose. Re-seated the cable and had no more faults.
 
8Y-20-05 – Head too low – EL called and said Rivmon faults were continuously popping up on numerous spots on this tool. Checked and end distance was trending right on the edge of out of tolerance consisteny on every spot. Re-nominalized everything after checking with inspectors. No more faults.
 
553 LH SWB Rear Doors – The saga continues with paint and the e-coat runout. At 12am tonight we went in and brought the hem adhesive further into the hem on all flanges above the window. Teardown looked good. Checked the robot programs out and found we call the same hem adhesive path for both Ford and Lincoln LH SWB doors. Went over to paint so they could show me the defect and how they were containing it. Not sure why they aren’t having the same problem with Lincolns. Only other thing I can think of is the inner to outer relationship is different on the Fords vs. the Lincolns. Could be possible the inner is “short” compared to the outer on the Ford which could allow some more space or “air” in the hem which would let e-coat in. Something worth investigating. They said they will monitor the doors built after the adjustment tonight and get back to us.",Main #5 - 6X-025PRB Coded Rail No Read Fault - Pallet number 20885 came through the system twice.

5C210-1: LWB LH Lincoln door adhesive on the hinge side of the door moved off location. Stopped the line and attempted to adjust adhesive path, this did not go well due to programming glitches curreny attributed to the new Fanuc teach pendant.

7K-40R-02, 7K-40L-08","#1 main.  Fault message displayed on the FIS boards when we arrived.  St 9p break we faulted and reset the light screen to clear the fault.
#2 main.  Faulted while Clarence was working inside the pallet perceptron cleaning cameras.
#3 and #5 main.  Sta 65 Nab pin issues.      ","A nut driver on the left hand rear door hinge was stripping out the nab pin and jamming in the fixture. Just before the 9:00 break the TMs tightened a loose dowel pin that was allowing extra lateral movement. This fixed the mechanical jamming, but the nab pin stripping continued. 
After production ended the toolmakers worked over the socket fixture. They cleaned some burrs that were interfering with the seating of the socket, and this seemed to resolve the stripping problem.
 
We swapped the #3 controller for sta 65 between the left and right sides.  Will see if this makes any difference.  
  
Looked at pallets sitting on dollies by pallet repair.  Pallet 20885 has code rail that is bowed down, not sure if this would cause an issue.  Pallet 20802 has a code rail that is bowed out, this will cause a problem for sure.   The code reader on the tooling tables in framer 1 sta 15 and 25 is mounted about 1/8” higher than the surrounding tables, sta 10 and sta 30.  I could not check sta 20.  Sta 15 and 25 tables have both had problems getting the code reader knocked off in the past.

The electrician toggled a bit in the plc that said ""Vision System initiate"" and it started right up and we did not have any issues with it after that. 
 
-LH Rear hinge set. They are still having issues with that nab pin. They said they left it on 8.5Nm torque from day shift for the spec limit but it was on 10Nm when I looked at it. Even if it was on 8.5Nm they still would have been faulting almost on as many. They were going to change the socket again between shifts hoping that will cause this issue to stop because the socket that was put in between shifts yesterday was a used socket.

8Y10-5: Max time exceeded and min depth not reached step 15 program 24. Found torque setting on step 15 at 7kN, programming sheet indicates it should be at 8kN. Changed to 8kN, step 15 RPM also reduced to 240 from 260 and voltage(pressure) reduced from 1.15v to 1.0. All of these changes were to prevent the min depth not reached(by increasing torque value thereby allowing the screw to screw to depth and the reduced RPM's and voltage were to combat the strip outs. Seemed to work .
