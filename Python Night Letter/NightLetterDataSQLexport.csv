Apprentices continued on with fitter tools.",,,,"Minor crash on the C50VL01 elevator.   Millwrights told electricians they needed the motor brake disabled to be able to turn the coupling by hand to align it with elevator when swapping drives.  That is only when swapping main drive to standby drive, when swapping standby to main it is not necessary.  Forgot to tell the electricians that.  Electricians edited around the brake circuit in the PLC.  In the meantime millwrights finished swapping the drives, unpinned the elevator and came out.  When the gates were closed and gates reset, the elevator took off up.  And over traveled.  When the electricians tried to lower the elevator, the Bart Simpson on the table got on the wrong side of its trigger and bent the Bart Simpson on the table.  Millwrights heated and straightened the Bart Simpson.  We ran the elevator up in automatic with no issue.           \nAll the underbody respot and underbody main robots have been moved to zero position or close to it for robot lubrication.
Replaced the two damaged driven rollers on roll bed #18 in the pallet farm.  Could not find new replacement rollers.  Revisited the donor table on the southwest corner of the upper level of the pallet farm and swapped rollers between the two tables.   I have ordered some rollers thru stores that may be the correct ones.  Els found blown fuse in panel for drive motor for lift table #32.  Fuse replaced and table working.  Millwrights are working and completed several PMs including aisle crossing shuttle carts and elevator drives swaps, except the AA39 elevator.

 Jeff Lindzy continued working on the stock pile of setter rebuilds we have accumulated.
 
Jay Wibbels continued on GBSDs and nose rebuilds.
 
Phil Dahl and Todd Dahl completed rebuilding the guns on the bench in the shop. They have all been tested and passed. One of the guns had the connection for the proportional valve snapped off. The cable and its connector were good but the pins and connector in the valve were broken. Tried to find our specific valve in stores with no luck. Found one labeled for 558 but it had a balance of zero. Talked to 558 JE and he said he had a handful in his shop so he gave me one. The one he provided is not exactly the same as the one on our gun. Ours is a little slimmer and has a different part number. The pushlock fitting is also a different style. Working with PF to locate fittings and exhaust port for the new proportional valve. However both valves have the same voltage, current and air pressure ratings so I don?t see it being an issue. I will work on getting our specific valve set up in stores though.
 
Jeff Fessel and Terry Lockhart continued to work on guide roller project for Satterwhite.
 
The guys have expressed they like the bracket that was made to hold weber guns on the table. Not sure who made it but I think it wouldn?t be a bad idea to make a bunch more and get a new table to attach them to. This will enable us to store and organize our guns in the shop better. Will also reduce likelihood of damaging connectors and components while sliding them around to work on them.",,,,"\nAccomplishments from weekend:

Electricians replaced all seven Jan Fans with Air Eye fans at skid load and underbody pullout and installed safety cables.  3 fans came from the cage at W28.  4 fans came from the boiler room.  Additional parts from the fans from the boiler room were placed in the W28 cage.  The old fans have been palletized and are sitting at W28, where should we put them?
Pipefitters looked at replacing the sealer package on robot 6X130-4 at W26 but had many questions.  We decided not to try it until we get more information as to how it should mount and the hoses ran.  Lots of brackets, no cables.

Millwrights started working on replacing the Philadelphia gearbox for roller flight #19 in the mezz around CC36, when we spun the input shaft of the rebuilt Philadelphia gearbox from our general stores, it sounded bad.  There is some backlash in the gearing on the input shaft.  The rebuilt gearbox may be worse than the current one we are running with.  We opted not to replace it.

Hulak and other electricians working on B42 light screen upgrades.  
  
Using prints from Joe Tutwiler, pipefitters mounted brackets and rerouted the sealer hose for the robot 6X-130-4 at W26. Because of the width of the cable tray, the robot program had to be updated to have a purge location outside of the tray. A tip-calibration stand also had to be moved, and the program was updated for that new location as well.
 
The movement of the sealer hose in the tray brings it uncomfortably close to an encoder cable near the base of the robot. A sheet metal shield could guide the hose away from the cable and protect the encoder. We need to follow up with the toolmakers about the design and fabrication of the shield. Need to follow up with toolmakers about protecting the encoder cable from the sealer hose on 6X-130-4.

I drove by and he explained to me what he was doing. I told him we should check the bit. Went in and found the bit was burnt up pretty badly. Replaced bit and still had quite a few faults. Took us some time to undo the adjustments the EL had made to the burnt up bit. We stopped running soon after this so it may or not be fixed now. Monitor at start up.
 
#2 ? 6X-20-06 ? Head too low ? 1x for 42min ? TMs were originally called to deal with a rivet feed issue. They replaced feedstick and while in there they noticed the die was loose so they tightened it. Well once it started back up the die broke for some reason. When the die broke it shattered the poke yoke and lodged the post in the c-frame. TMs spent some time extracting the die and in the process stripped out the set screw so they then had to extract that. They also went back to the shop to get a new poke yoke which then was dropped in the cell and lost under a mess of cable tray/fixturing. We couldn?t find it. I had them install the die without the poke yoke to get us running while I retrieved one from stores. Was able to get 3 from stores. In order to avoid another die break we stopped the line again and installed the new poke yoke.
 
#4 ? 6X-20-06 ? Rivet stuck in tube ? 2x for 25min ? Rivet not making it to feedstick. TMs came and cleared rivet. This eventually turned into rivet not trapped faults. Feedstick was replaced and dynamic tube was cut and terminated again. Did not repeat.
 
#5 ? 6X-60-04 ? Step 7 max depth exceeded ? 8x for 20min ? Gun #1 faulting due to screw not making it to nose. Instructed EL to swap gun until we could work on it between shifts.

#1 ? 8A-100-01 ? Nut not present with ram advanced ? 2x for 1hr50min ? When I arrive the jaw on the feed arm was broken due to the ram firing on top of it. We did not have a new jaw but the TMs were able to straighten the shoulder bolt and install it back on the tool to run. It was then the EL realized the prox that detects the nut was damaged. Took a while to locate a new prox. We found one and installed it. No further issues. Prox could have been root cause of the arm being damaged. Jaw is still damaged and will need to be replaced. Stores shows zero but I think we have some hiding somewhere?.maybe? There is a pan that needs a SPAC nut repair. Do not recall what repair we are allowed to do on these.

They couldn?t reach the screw at its maintenance positon so the EL moved the tool to a better position. TMs were able to extract the stem and install a new die in the die post. EL sent robot in from the touched up position causing it to crash into the fencing and overhead cable tray. Had to move the robot manually to home and get it to pick back up where it left off.

While watching the CT run it was noticed that when a unit was set down on the chain that it would skip. Had S. Vessels adjust the chain at 11 and did not have any faults afterwards","Snyder ? A-Crew ? 8/26/19
#3 ? 6X-20-02 ? Rivet time delay exceeded ? 1x for 31min ? Slew of faults led to this. Basically tool lost its I/O and faulted for that. Somewhere in the recovery of that it lost the sequence of the rivet in the nose. EL was from out of area and didn?t know how to recover which led to multiple rivets being fed to the feedstick causing it to jam up. TMs came and cleared a handful of rivets and off it went.

6X-180-03 ? Double rivet ? 4x for 10min ? 2mm washer was installed over the weekend. Appears we have been running without since last die change/die break. This threw Rivmon off which required us to reteach it.
 
#2 ? 9C-230-01 ? Profil press not advanced ? 1x for 1hr12min ? At end of dayshift they had an issue with a stud being smashed/stuck in the head. TMs and PFs replaced head at EOS. When we got here at 7p it still wasn?t running. The new head was not functioning properly. After an extended breakdown due to shift change/hand-off we went in and start looking at it with the A-Crew TMs. Found the previous shift PFs had plumbed the new head incorrectly?the hoses being switched was causing the issue. Once we corrected that and got it all back in sequence things took off and ran.

#1 ? 6X-20-02 ? Tool I/O Node Mismatch ? 10x for 40min ? EL kept keeping it limping by resetting. Went in a few times and checked to make sure everything was secure. No luck. Went in at lunch to take a better look. Noticed we pulling cable where it comes out of Leoni we could get the I/O to flicker on the Henrob. Re-routed and secured cable with Velcro. Faults continued?as EL was watching it from the fence he saw the D-Net cable was rubbing on the motor of the setter as it ran. Suspecting interference the EL adjusted the cable routing further to keep it away from the motor. Once he did this we had no more faults the remainder of the shift. A new D-Net cable is in the crib ready to be swapped but I think we have it resolved. I was told cable was already changed last week. Monitoring.
 
#2 ? 8Y-20-02 ? Nose switch fault ? 2x for 29min ? At shift change tool went down with nose switch fault. TMs and PFs headed straight there when they got in.

7K-40-L04 ? Feed fault ? 27x for 13min ? ELs kept resetting and feeding fresh tape in. Noticed the valve was not lighting up when it was being told to fire. They then swapped the signal cables on the valve island with no success. We then ran a new temp D-net cable from the ATI to the I/O block?while doing this we changed the GBSD. The faults went away to we went back in and removed the temp cable and it continued to run without faults. Nose switch still is not making like it should?GBSD has been changed 4 times in 2 weeks. I?ll continue to monitor and look into it.
 
7X-30-L01 ? Head too high ? 14x for 12min ? As I was coming in I got the call that the rivets were out of spec on the high end. Setter was pretty loud, end distance was trending low and force was trending high. To keep them running we increased velocity hoping it would make it to lunch. It ran for a bit and then the rivets were out of spec again. Stopped the line to change the setter. TMs brought another 250072 setter over and put it on. This setter would not even calibrate because the punch was sitting too low. Brought another setter in and installed it without issue and tool ran rest of shift. TMs will need to disassemble the second setter and see if there is a piece internally missing that would cause the punch to not seat fully.

8G-400-02 ? Travis Myers called and asked for some assistance. He said he was randomly getting head too low faults because the gun fired without a rivet. Tool rivets in an operator load fixture. After watching it one time you could see the GBSD was hitting a part of the fixture on its 3rd rivet spot. This caused the GBSD to hang up while the gun fired resulting in the punch pushing the rivet out onto the floor before the nose contacted the part. Between shifts Travis touched program up to correct this. He said it was hitting on 3 different spots. All are corrected now.

#4 ? 8Y-10-05 ? FDS ? 2x for 22min ? Step 5 max time exceeded. Broken belt. Gun pulled and swapped with one from the shop between shifts. Did not have time to step through but we put it on and ran it in auto on 3 jobs and didn?t have any issues. Instructed EL to swap if it started faulting at start up. If swapped it will need to be stepped through both LWB and SWB. FYI there are 4 guns on the table in the shop with no notes on what?s wrong with them. I haven?t pulled any guns out of the line in a long while so I can?t put information to them?makes it hard to determine what?s wrong or track issues with specific guns if we don?t know why they were pulled in the first place or where they came from. The one from tonight is red tagged with the robot and the issue.
 
#6 ? 8Y-80-02 ? Head too high ? 7x for 19min ? All faults occurred before we arrived at 7. Looked into it at lunch and saw it was only faulting on spots 3 and 33. End distance was riding the line. Adjusted nominal. No more issues.
 
#7 ? 6X-20-17 ? Head too high ? 7x for 17min ? Did not fault during our shift. Adjustments made seemed to have fixed it.
 
#10 ? 6Y-150-01 ? Feed fault ? 2x for 15min ? ELs called TMs and PFs over to swap GBSD after troubleshooting for a while. They said it may be a rivet present cable but weren?t sure. Went over and noticed the bulkhead was loose. After tightening no more issues. GBSD was fine.
 
#1 ? 9B-220-01 ? Feeder escapement PP not made ? 2x for 2hr ? First occurrence was 1hr45min. Walked in to the line being down. They said it hadn?t even started up. Both 210 and 220 were down. TMs cleared escapement and cycled it without issue. It remained down while we worked on 210.
 
#2 ? 9B-210-01 ? Stud not made ? 3x for 1hr49min ? Walked in to tool being down. Hadn?t started up since 6p. TMs had to clear 3 smashed studs from the head. It was so jammed they had to pry the head off to clear them. Once they got it all clear they couldn?t get a stud out consistently. Ended up finding the feed tube was split right before the head. PFs had enough slack to cut and re-terminate the feed tube removing the split portion. Once everything was clear and studs were being fed properly we were able to finish the first part but then everything was out of sequence so it took a bit to get it all back going again.
 
#3 ? 8G-400-02 ? Abs position invalid ? 17x for 1hr37min ? Setter was swapped today during the day. Looking at the fault log it appears they had issues homing and calibrating but decided to leave it messed up. Kept getting Rivmon faults and home offset was drifting. Went and re-homed the tool but also noticed the tool stroke was off by 7mm. Appears they calibrated on top of a rivet which is why we kept getting the Rivmon faults. Re-calibrated the tool and it ran for a little bit. Eventually the home offset drifted again and the tool would not re-home itself. Swapped setter to get it back going. If there is an issue homing a setter it should not be left on the tool to run at start up.
 
#6 ? 9A-40-02 ? FDS ? 4x for 42min ? A few max time faults. One of which occurred while we were working on the #3 CM setter swap.
 
#9 ? 8A-120-02 ? Nose switch fault/Rivmon faults ? New setter from weekend. SWB wasn?t taught. Taught Rivmon for SWB but also had issues feeding a rivet. TMs and PFs swapped GBSD. No further issues.

Kept trying to swap guns but it wouldn?t move because it was faulted and losing control voltage at the weber controller. Cycled power on the controller and that got rid of the failed friction test fault. TMs replaced belt from the one that broke over in UB last night.

Night Crew (Worstell): 
Was called over to Vow Cell for the Perceptron having grey sensors on many of the points. The grey sensors showed up on the top right part of the vehicle, the liftgate, and the hood. The Perceptron server and computer were reset to fix this issue. 
 
There were a few liftgates at the beginning of shift on chassis, SWB LWB Navigators & Expeditions,  that were ''twisted'' where the right side was outboard and the left was inboard. This problem did not continue and there is no evidence of this problem in the data per BIW measurements.

Believe this issue was caused from the system getting a fault at the exit end of the system. I plan to look into breaking up the auto zones to alleviate this issue.
 
While on the subject of the exit end of Pallet Farm, I altered the logic to allow the lift tables to lower once they are raised and have unit on memory. The reason we were getting faults is that sometimes the pallets sit on top of the sheaves of the rollers and don't make the in position prox. Without this prox made, the table would not lower even if it had unit on memory.\n\nParts:",,,

Per the most recent VOW Cell data, the #1 issue was WIDE MARGIN between EXP Liftgate to RH D-Pillar. Hobbs and I viewed the data and concluded that we are intentionally running the Liftgate Opening almost 3mm WIDER (10.5mm) than intended (8mm); therefore the margins inevitably are wider. Judging off the lack of warranty and the visual look of things, we decided to widen the VOW Cell specs to 6.0mm max margin from 5.5mm max margin: this should eliminate 75% of the rejects per the las 371 data points.
 
We also made a shift in the EXP liftgates 0.5mm towards the RIGHT (passenger) side of the vehicle to even out the margins on both sides.
 
  
9/20/2019 @ 9:00am Closures Liftgate Hang Perceptron SWB & LWB EXP REAR RIGHT 0.5mm BSR #  Lowe / Hobbs Moved ALL EXP Liftgates towards the RH (passenger) Side of the cab in the y-axis 0.5mm via Perceptron controls in Cell Maintenance to reduce #1 VOW Cell concern of EXP liftgates TOO WIDE to RH D-pillar per data and measurements 
 
 
 
The #2 issue on VOW Cell is FLUSHNESS to LOW between the Hood and Center of LH Fender. I?ve taken some measurements using my dial indicator gage and although I?m sure I?m not using the same datum as the VOW Cell, I am getting almost 1.0mm difference in readings. Over the weekend, I will use a Laser gage to get more reliable and accurate data, but from the looks of the hood to fender, the flushness looks great on units the VOW Cell is rejecting. After compiling the data from the laser gage, I?m sure we?re going to see a sizeable difference in the actual readings vs VOW Cell readings and will eventually make an offset to alleviate these concerns.
 
More than likely, I will make a shift on the Liftgate Hang Perceptron for SWB NAVs: the LH side of SWB NAV liftgates are consistently running about 1.0mm higher than its mating LH D-pillar shoulder. I?ll eventually make a 0.5mm shift DOWNWARD on the LH side ONLY to start and monitor the change over the next couple of weeks.

CAL 1 VOW update:
 The sensor is back ?close? to the original position using match marks. We confirmed that the sensor does still fire.  We ran the calibration program on the robot and confirmed there was no damage to the robot sensor.  Tim checked the DCS for the robot and confirmed that the robot CAN get to the sensor in teach mode, so we suspect that is how this happened (without having been here), so we plan to fix that once we get the cell running again to protect these sensors.
 
We have been able to speak with one of the engineers from perceptron and he is looking into the recovery for us. At this point he suspects we will have to build a new algorithm for the visual fixture which will require touch ups to the robot programs, which I believe will require us to get Perceptron in house, but he is still investigating with the engineers who installed the cell.
 
Ultimately the station will be in bypass tonight and tomorrow while we work to resolve all this. I?ll send that info to the CAL team. ",

Paint Adhesive Squeeze Out Complaints ? Being down on dash did not have chance to arrange units for touch up. Looking at units at T23 both LWB and SWB have opportunity on the door openings. Some have squeeze out concerns between the bodyside inner and outer which would be addressed in 7X-10. Some have squeeze out concerns on door openings between the bodyside and UB side sill which would be addressed in 6W-20. Below are areas I noted but it would be best to stand at T23 and check a few units to get a clear understanding. I think the issue has spiked up due to an issue with the bodyside outer to inner fit. Not sure if it has changed but you can visibly see the flange on the outer is shorter than the inner which causes the squeeze out to come through. Leaving bodysides all looks good but when it is married to the UB and ran through respot it squeezes out. T23 is best place to check.

#1 ? 6X-180-02 ? Collision detect ? 2x for 1hr9min ? Robot bypassed starting rotation 5580 and ending last bad 5682 (first good 5683) ? Henrob gun ran into the windshield opening of unit. ELs called me over because they said it was ?way off.? While I was on my way Leo Mejias began investigating and found that 4 of the 6 bolts that hold to Henrob gun to the faceplate of joint 6 were missing. We found 2 of the 4 bolts sheared off on the floor. At this point we sent production on early lunch. Leo taught the robot down to the ground by the access gate, locked out robot so the TMs were able to begin the process of removing the gun off the robot and transferring it to a cart. In the process of removing the gun we realized 1 of the 2 bolts holding it was broken as well and the last one was nearly sheared through. The 2 dowel pins were also backed out/broken. With everything locked out the ELs disconnected all electrical, PFs removed air and plugged the hose and then the TMs began removing the gun and securing it on a cart. With the gun off the robot and the air hose plugged we were able to move the robot back to its minor maintenance position where it stayed in bypass the remainder of the shift. At EOS TMs removed the broken bolts from the robot and mounted the gun back to the robot. ELs connected cables and PFs put air back on the tool. We verified everything was in position and able to run on a few units without issues. The sister tool 6X-180-01 was inspected for broken bolts and nothing was found. Robot and gun are good to go. There should be no more units needing containment at start-up.

Vow Cell was down when I came in. Upon inspection I noticed that PC1 (Server) was not booting up. Whenever we tried to switch from PC2 to PC1 it was say no signal and then go black.

At this point, I had systems come and take a look at it and they said that they were pretty certain that the motherboard was bad.

Rotation 5706 was removed from the damaged pallet and placed on a good pallet.  Inserted the job at the end of framer 1 and it ran through the rest of framer with no issue.  Problem happened when there was an AVS mismatch at C06.  We were able to assign the rotation number to the new pallet number at pallet to skid.  We also had to assign the rotation number to the skid that had already been loaded and then skip the skid load AVS back one.  Lesson learned was that if a unit needs transferred onto a new pallet that scheudling needs to be called and given the CID and new pallet number to associate them before the job is put back into the line.  The job is on its way to closures now.",

-Ensured Door Fitters had and were using gauges due to VOW cell still being down. Got more tools for LVC to use to measure vehicles.
 
- I was called over to the P558_Framer Perceptron. There was a communication fault on the Perceptron. The electrician said this will happen sometimes when the line drops into auto. I had them hard restart the Perceptron and that seemed to make it work. 
 
-There were concerns from a supervisor about the reject points on the measurement monitor that was pulled up at the P558_Perceptron Station. Most of the vehicles on Cell Monitor were ?rejects? because of a couple of points that are rejecting every time. Based off of what I saw, those few points that were rejecting every time were due to the Perceptron having trouble reading these specific points.
 
- They were having problems tonight with the Hood Hinge/Hydroform at CC34. The issue is the lower hole on the outside of the Hydroform on the RH side. This is the only hole that they are having issues with. The operator said that he would have a few in a row that were good and then a few in a row that were overshadowed. I went over to where the hydroform is put on and the alignment looked perfect. After it goes through the framing gate there is a place to look at it again and I noticed that those same holes from before the framing gate that looked good were now overshadowed. From what I was seeing, the problem is when it goes through the framing gate. ",,,\n\nParts:,,We are recoding the load and pre-pload stops on the RH body side conveyor.

7K40R-2: Works package on Weber gun","Hobbs Update:
 
Night shift started experiencing issues with the RH Cowl Side bolt secure on Closure 1 and had to input containment due to over shadow from the hydroform tube. Started investigation and discovered there were multiple issues:
 
1. The nut on the Cowl Side is running 1.5 mm forward and Low (data in attachments). This is done in P558. I contacted Dave Fletcher and they made an adjustment to the nut position to bring it to zero. I will complete a follow up measurement tomorrow to verify the nuts are back in the correct position.
2. The RH Hydroform tube made a 1.0 mm upward shift yesterday during production. (data attached in powerpoint) This could be seen in the CMM data along with Perceptron (although the shift was not enough to throw a reject alarm). I went in the framer and found that the 4 way pin for the hydroform tube was bent. We removed the detail and the dowels were fine, and when we reinstalled it the pin was straight. 
 
This is the second time we've had damage to our hydroform tube pins in the last year causing the tube positions to shift. I believe the cause of this is that there are no wipers on the gates (like there were on the 473/22X gates) to guide the tubes onto the pins, so we are putting a lot of pressure on the pins when the gates advance. I am working on designing some wipers to install in the station that will hopefully take some stress off the pins",,,\nReplaced the I/O power cables on robot 7X-20L-R02.\nParts:,,"We caught the load stop carrier crash issue on video today.

The actual issue was the pin clamp was tight going into the locating hole (4 way).  I was told that they had changed the pin clamp shortly before I got there. They also changed out the solenoid valve. When they changed the pin clamp they put a C6075 pin clamp where on the LH Box Outer there was a C6074 pin clamp. So they changed it again to a C6074 to match what was on the LH Box Outer line and there were no issues after that.

Fault was able to be reset so we assumed we were good to go. When we started up after lunch the faults came back. After investigating further we found we could control the fault by moving a small 5-pin cable that ran from a splitter to the valve manifold on the magazine assembly plate. We found what appeared to be a used cable in the lineside cabinet and installed it in hopes of clearing the fault. This did not work. Looked around for a cable with no luck. Found some in GS and purchased 3 of them. We installed a new cable and the faults went away for the remainder of the shift. The long d-net cable is still strung outside of the Leoni.

#4 ? 6Y-90-04 ? Feed fault ? 2x for 20min ? Tape chewed up due to misfeed. Swapped GBSD and nose. No further issues.
 
#1 ? 9A-10-02 ? Feed fault ? 1x for 1hr53min ? Line was down since 6:30p. No word from anyone until 7:30p. Was told they had a crash on days and never got out of it. When we got over there the panel view was showing a ?head not back? fault for the Henrob on 10-02. Henrob showed home and its I/O showed the same. Did some digging in the logic trying to figure out why the robot was getting ?failed to run task.? After a while with no luck and a few cycle powers we stumbled on the ?rivet 1? being turned off in the robot general IF menu. Once we turned it back on the issues went away and we ran. With ?rivet 1? turned off the robot was looking for a second gun. Which explains why it did not see head back because there was no gun to send the signal.
 
#5 ? 8F-130-01 ? Press not advanced ? 1x for 40min ? Out of area electrician working. Got a call he was getting press not advanced. By the time we got over there the punch assembly was absolutely obliterated. Pieces everywhere. EL said it happened in auto?unlikely. Without knowing what happened the TMs replaced the entire assembly and then we tried to run. At this point we had issues with the nut feeding into the jaw. TMs had to adjust the stop on the spring and filed a burr off the jaws. Good to go now.
 
#8 ? 8G-410-01 ? Feed fault low rivets ? 1x for 26min ? Tool ran out of rivets while we were down on HFE.
 
9B-245-01 ? Issues with slugs hanging on. Die was replaced on days. We put another one on with no luck. TMs took die back to show and knocked a bit of the radius on the inside off which gave it more of a sharp edge to cut the slug. No further issues.
 
RH Front DOP Sealer ? Spent entirely too much time trying to track this tonight. Took all BS tools down to maintenance and inspected all clamps and wipers. No excessive sealer present. Checked all bodysides in the line and did not see the famous speck. Checked all units in framer seg 1. No speck to be found. Checked units in framing seg 2. No speck. Checked units in framing respot.

6Y-180-03 ? Wouldn?t return from retracted position. Stuck staying up. Swapped to finish shift. Between shifts PM?d it and found the jam nut for the hold down pressure was backed off so it had no air to return the head. Adjusted pressure and had no more issues.
 
7K-30-R04 ? Inspectors called about suspect parts that were good. Checked faults and saw some min depth not reached on a few programs. Depth was at -1.0 or -1.2mm. Added 0.5nm of torque to some spots but still had some issues. Adjusted depth target to -1.4 on some spots.",,,,\n\nParts:,,,

9B245-1W: Arnold nuts failing pull test as low as 500lbs vs 1100lbs set point. Replaced punch, die and adjusted air pressure. Verified test equipment to another in the shop to verify similar results. After parts were replaced we checked 100% for 1 hour then checked every hour for the remainder of the day. Checked parts in rack from previous shift and did not find any failures. 
 
8Y120-3: Button did not look fully formed with flat spot on one side. Found die loose and partially full of metal. Not sure what is causing this but please monitor. 
 
8F130-1W: Nut feed arm bent. Straightened. Took additional time to get tooling back in sync, system seemed to have developed a mind of it's own and fought us the entire way requiring a fly by from Tim Zinkan. 
 
7L30-3: gun 2 double rivet fault. Inspected gun and part but did not find anything. Sent back in, double rivet. Homed setter from 5.127 to 5.004. Sent in on next part and ran fine until previous part attempted to clamp up in next station. Found root cause of double rivet had been an extra part that transferred. Tooling got all wadded up in swap outs creating additional downtime. 
 
8X80-3: Feed fault. Swapped GBSD, sent back in crashing into bent metal that had mysteriously appeared. Had to replace the punch after this because of the gap in materials the rivet tumbled and chipped it.

#3 ? 6X-160-02 ? Feed fault ? 2x for 25min ? ELs called because tape wouldn?t feed. Called TMs and PFs to swap GBSD. TMs adjusted the nose switch housing which didn?t work and then they swapped GBSD.
 
8Y-110-03 ? Buttons look like absolute trash. Between shifts I had the Super Dahl Bros check and mess with alignment on it. Check units in the AM to see if it got any better. I was told we had this issue before and it was fixed on days. I cannot recall what we did. I checked the die and you can clearly see it is not worn on about 30% of the die. McClure states he already went through robot program and made sure it was against the metal and not at an awkward angle.
 
#2 ? 5B-50-03 ? Nose switch fault ? 1x for 44min ? Punch broke off inside the nose. Took some effort to beat the GBSD off due to the sheared punch. Replaced punch, GBSD and nose. After this we began having double rivet faults due to the home offset being off from the punch change. Re-homed the tool successfully and ran well the rest of shift.
 
#3 ? 9A-20-01 ? Lock pin not extended ? 1x for 30min ? Pin on the horizontal nut press was not reached extended position. EL was not from area and unfamiliar with the tool. After some poking around we realized the pin was not reaching position because slug was attached to the hold in the hydroform which was stopping the pin from reaching its position. We backed the robot out of the tool and removed the slug and it took off without issue the rest of shift.
 
#5 ? 9B-245-01 ? Clinch nut escapement not extended ? 2x for 19min ? Nuts jammed in escapement. TMs came and disassembled, cleaned and oiled. No more issues. Operators/inspectors reported slugs still on the nuts but they were all passing torque checks. We did not make any adjustments to the tooling. I think alignment may be off. We went in and there is up and down play on the linear bearing rail of the tool.
 
Front Door ? Around 9:45p I got a call that hem adhesive was off location on a torn down door. When I got there I realized it wasn?t just off location it was either completely missing or so far off location it was not even close to the hem. Went in and immediately noticed the nozzle was broken off the ped. I asked if they had just switched models and was told they had ran 80 doors of that model. Looking at the racks of doors built every single door had a glob of hem adhesive on the inner which indicated the nozzle was broken. The ELs then informed me that they had a crash due to a damaged outer making its way in the cell at 7:30p. We are confident that this is when the nozzle was broken so we went back and checked the previous model of doors ran and found a few racks of those bad as well. Inspector is supposed to check the first door off the line when model change occurs. She failed to do this which resulted in us building over 80 bad doors. She is also to check her adhesive visually while line is running once per hour. This also could not have been done. Production is all lined up with the facts/data/ammunition. Tony Redd said they will be talking with inspector tonight. I will line David Sidorowicz up as well.

The area was not large and not a show stopped but we had PFs come over and adjust pre-pressure to try and get more volume at beginning of bead. This seemed to help slightly. We also slowed down the robot moves during that part of the path which seemed to help the most. Ran for a little bit and then I got a call back saying it looked worse. The thin spot was back and now we had some stringers and a loop getting on the class A surface. We stopped the line and stepped the robot through the path. You could clearly see the path needed some work. The nozzle was moving up and down away from the part in numerous areas. There was also a point that moved down away from the flange when it should not have. We adjusted numerous points of the program and the first few parts showed some improvement in some areas while others still needed adjustment. It appeared we taught it too close on some spots so we backed them off.

5J200-2: Came in to find the lincoln liftgates running but not covering more than 60%, stopped the line and started working on the program. Was able to get Phil Risinger to come over and he cleared up a lot of the open questions we had concerning how things talked to each other. After revieiwing all of our data he determined that we needed to up our pre-pressure. This did not help and by the time we determined this we had run out of Lincoln parts and had to switch to Ford Models. Ford program proved out that we did not have an obstruction in the line. Set up to have 10 Lincoln parts ready to load into the line for program touch up. Bryan Wolf is working on this. 
 
9A40-2: Multiple issues. Walked up to find it faulted with an error I have not seen before.''Too many screws in system''. Called toolmakers who found 2 screws stuck at the brake. Cleared and after homing the spindle we were able to start running. Changes were made to program 2 step 7 to get it running. The data indicated we were missing the clearance hole and the screw was sitting up 2mm. This got it running and the plan was to touch up the program at the end of the shift.

Subs #5 ? S200VN1 Front Door camera faults ? Camera was bumped while something was being painted over the weekend. Had to realign camera while hooked up to it.","Snyder ? A-Crew ? 10/21/19
#4 ? 8X-100-06 ? Feed fault ? 4x for 50min ? 4D attached. Walked into issue. They were about to put on the THIRD GBSD. TMs also had already stoned the punch to remove a burr they saw. Third GBSD was already being installed so I let them finish. Still were getting feed faults immediately. Went into the cell to check it out and noticed right away the rivet present cable was mangled. Had small discussion with the EL about actually troubleshooting the problem instead of just throwing parts at it. Cable could have been identified immediately if it was looked at or wiggled. Swapped rivet present cable and did not have any other issues the rest of the shift.
 
#8 ? 8Y-10-05 ? TC1 PP still made ? 2x for 30min ? 4D attached. Both guns in station 10 did not start up well after program touch ups. Went to swap them both to gun #1 and they both locked up during the tool change program. Could not really find what was going on so we manually stepped them through the process and were able to run. After looking into the robot program edits it appears both tool change programs were edited this weekend. No clue who or why but they were?maybe Marty knows?
 
#9 ? 6Y-80-08 ? Pin returned not made ? 5x for 23min ? ELs called for TMs saying the pin wouldn?t return because it was dirty. TMs came and cleaned. Issue was still present. EL then said it was due to it binding on the part. I asked if they had tried to manually valve the pin to see if it indeed was bound on the part. They had not?we went in and valved it and it moved as free as a bird. I then inquired as to what tells us if the pin is retracted?oh the prox. Checked and it was indeed so loose it was just sliding all around the bracket. Once prox was set and tightened issue went away. PHEW!
 
#10 ? 6Y-80-09 ? FDS ? 7x for 22min ? Getting a strange fault on program 4 for step 5 max time exceeded. Only that one program?generally this is a bad belt or transducer. Transducer checked fine and belt did as well. Swapped to gun #1 to see if it followed and it did not. Between shifts we cleaned the ATI pins and ELs wanted to swap transducer cable so we did that. Will monitor at start up.
 
8Y-10-06 ? On gun #1. Needs touched up. Programs not centered in clearance holes on back. Dropped the ball on staging jobs to get it done tonight. Sorry.
8Y-10-05 ? May need touched up. But the bit was also shot on it at start up. Put new bit in and put it back on gun #2. See if it starts up alright with the new bit.
7K-40-R02 ? On gun #1. Has been since last week. I didn?t get a chance to get to it tonight. Will try to work on it today. Only faulting on one spot. Most likely can be resolved with touch up or parameter adjustments.
7G-50-R01 ? On gun #1. Not sure when or why this one swapped. Just noticed it at end of shift. Will try to see what?s going on with it tonight.","C.Lowe (10/19 - 10/20 Weekend)

8Y10-5: Min depth not reached program 17 step 15 x17, verified screw was fully down and seated then adjusted depth parameter to -2.2mm then copied program positional data over from LWB to SWB program. Will monitor at start up. Toolchange programs compared to find issues encountered last night. Found TC Lock DI 633 and TC Unlock DI 634 both set to ON in verify program on both robots to be root cause of toolchange program failures last night. Fat fingers appear to be the root cause although no one really wants to own it. 
 
8Y10-6: Min depth not reached program 14 step 14. Analog depth reading at -20 all the way to -32.4, went in to look at screw on next fault and found a screw in the hole at an estimated depth of -20 and another screw in the jaws attempting to drive into the screw head. Not sure how this happened, I was there the entire time and nobody touched the controller. PM'd gun at lunch and faults have tapered off. 
 
7X20R-3: Feed faults. Swapped GBSD. 2 hours later faults reoccurred, inspected tape and found it under pulling and air pressure at 38psi. Adjusted to 41psi and faults cleared up. 
 
5J240-3: Hem adhesive smeared around lower RH Ford window opening on outer panel from part present switch mounted too close to part. Found bracket had two sets of holes for mounting so I had it slotted between shifts and moved back a bit to stay out of the adhesive.

#3 ? 8X-40-02 ? Feed fault ? 5x for 35min ? First occurrence the ELs were with me on rear ladder and we did not see the line was done for about 10min. They were able to reset it but it eventually came back. TMs and PFs were called to swap GBSD. No more issues.
 
#5 ? 8Y-10-05 ? Step 15 min depth not reached ? 14x for 22min ? Still seeing the min depth faults on program 17 as noted from dayshift. We were not meeting the opened up -2.0mm depth. Inspectors still said the screw was seated. We stopped the line briefly to touch up that one spot on both models. With bringing the gun closer to the part we were able to hit a depth of -0.5-0.7mm consistently and eliminate the faults completely. Great work on both guns today?they ran very well!
 
#9 ? 8Y-30-04 ? Feed fault ? 5x for 12min ? EL kept resetting fault to keep line moving. Tape was getting chewed up pretty bad. Just before lunch we had TMs and PFs come swap GBSD. No more issues rest of shift.
 
#4 ? 8F-125-01 ? Head too high ? 6x for 34min ? Still having issues with buttons breaking of steel bracket. Production has been setting stock aside to try and figure out if it is an issue with specific lots/dates. We changed the spool of rivets to a different batch and it seemed to help slightly but did not clear up faults completely. With the issue with the brackets I would lean towards that being the root cause. In the mean time I told the ELs to keep sending units as suspect and had the inspector ready to check with adhesive tape to put over the broken buttons.

Hemmers and date stamps.",,,Ron Koontz and Joe Shelton were recognized at the SPRB for their efforts in bringing control of ladders into the realm of safety. Ron came up with a genius numbering system that gives all the information needed to control which ladder is where and where it belongs. The location of ladders fell on Joe to distribute and have ladders readily available for breakdowns and repairs. The two together implemented a tile tracking system that allows safety inspections to locate and monitor the ladders on the floor. Within a few minutes all SUV body ladders can be verified to be where they are designated to be. As more people use the system the better it gets.,\n\nParts:,,,

#3 ? 6Y-90-07 ? Head too low ? 4x for 27min ? End distance suddenly spiked out of tolerance. ELs called me over because it was faulting every rivet. Home offset hadn?t drifted much but we re-homed it successfully. I went in and checked the rivets and they looked and measured fine so I had the ELs put Rivmon into teach 100. I also went and notified the inspector to check all jobs as they pass through T23. After teach 100 ran out we started faulting again. Rivets now were sitting very high (about half inserted). Setter wouldn?t retract or home. Taught robot to maintenance and the TMs replaced the setter it was on its last rebuild before its 4M cycle and had 221k cycles on it. Checked forward and did not find any jobs with bad rivets so containment was not needed. No issues after new setter and Rivmon teaching.
 
#5 ? 6X-90-05 ? Nose switch fault ? 1x for 17min ? EL said he had two instances of nose switch fault. Went over and removed tape from the nose and the switch stayed on. Looking into the nose you could see the switch was stuck in the up position. We toggled it with a  screw driver and it returned to its normal position but TMs were already on the way to swap it. Thinking in cases like this we could test a graphite lube or alcohol to spray on the switch to free it up. GBSD had 226k cycles on it and I believe it could have continued to run with a bit of love on the switch. New GBSD runs fine so that tells me the punch didn?t cause damage to the switch itself.

 - Added 0.5mm to the LWB NAV 4-way Pin and 2-way at the RH Front Door Hinge Set to move the LWB NAV front doors fore due to fit concerns, Vow Cell data, and LVC concerns. This should fix the tight door to door margins that we are seeing at LVC. This can potentially be moved more but I wanted to be able to see how they were coming into the pre fit station before it was shimmed more. 
 
- LVC had some RH front doors that the hinges were bent from the doors being flexed too much by fitters. I spoke to the chassis and VOW cell fitters to make sure they were not flexing the doors too much. 
 
- Pallet 0887 rejected by -14mm and it was ran through again to see if it was just a bad read and it read +10mm. This pallet has been consistently misreading on U102_RH_Pad so it was wiped off and it read good. I?ll be checking this pallet the next time it runs through to see if it continues to get good readings.  
 
- Found in WDBM that the links for VOW cell data are saying they are updating but when you zoom in on the charts the actual data in the graphs is not updating (it shows the date for each point). 
 
- We had a couple more of the hoods that are dented when they are closed due to the latch being closed. The fitters were notified of this problem so they know to look for it. They were repaired by EOL and like Chris Lowe said in the night letter a few days ago the CMA suppliers have been contacted about this issue. 
 
- Had an electrician touch up the robot program for the dropoff of the lower outer lift gate into the 5J-210 fixture. After this we stopped having problems with getting the burr in the 2 way hole.

#1 ? 7K-40-R08 ? Weber tebacle ? 2hrs ? When I came in at 7p I was informed RHBS had not run a single unit due to a Weber being down. They said that neither gun would work and it would not complete an eject sequence. By the time I got there they had already temped a signal cable bypassing the IGUS with no luck. I then attempted to have them adjust and set the analog depth sensor to make it run. When adjusting it the values were jumping all over the place. At this point we installed a jumper signal cable from the gun to the robot in order to rule out the ATI. Attempted to adjust sensor again and saw the same issues. We then took the temp cable and ran it from the gun all the way to the Weber controller directly. This would rule out ANY cable in the system. Same issues. At this point we tried a completely new analog depth sensor?no luck. We located the prints and traced the analog depth sensor wire back to the WSP2 module inside the controller. It is rare for these to fail but it was the only thing left. Satterwhite was able to locate one and we were able to successfully swap it out and install the old memory card retaining all of our settings and programming information. With the new WSP2 we were able to successfully set the analog depth sensor to rear its advanced position. Once it was set the tool was able to run without any issues. Only work done in the area over the weekend was robot lubrication which should not have caused us any issues like this.
 
#5 ? 6X-60-02 ? Step 15 max time exceeded ? 11x for 33min ? Els stated gun #1 was constantly faulting for step 15 strip out. They switched to gun #2 to keep the line running. Gun #2 was running just as bad. TMs came over at end of shift and replaced both bits as they were both blue and rounded out. ELs are working on touching up programs on gun #2 right now just so we can get one of the guns running. Gun #1 will need to be touched up and fixed by dayshift at EOS.
 
#1 ? 5B-30-03 ? Sealer doser not filled ? 2x for 2hr25min ? Purple adhesive change over did not go well. There was quite a bit of downtime while we were down on bodysides but when I got over there it was still down. I was told they spent quite a bit of time purging the system trying to get the old 410A material out of the system and adjusting settings to get it to stop oozing out inconsistently. The adhesive was just running out of the nozzle non-stop and every single door we were building was scrap. I stopped the line until we could get it fixed. At this point Eric Rossignol replaced the dispense valve which seemed to stop the non-stop leak and allow us to apply the bead as needed. I was told they had to mess with temperatures so I am not sure if some old 410A had hardened in the valve or what?after new valve was installed the doors looked better. Upon teardown we had a few thin spots so we increased the seal schedule volume from the teach pendant. The bead looked better after this and was bought off by inspectors. Probably need a little better plan and execution for material changes next time.
 
#3 ? 7G-70-L01 ? Step 15 max time ? 15x for 52min ? Strip outs on program 7. EL checked robot program and found it was off and rubbing the clearance hole. He touched it up but still had issues. Found the bit was blue and rounded out. Replaced bit which helped slightly. Still some issues.

Went in the cell and found the punch laying on the unit.

Which then was causing us to continue to try and torque a screw that was fully seated?thus eating up the bit and stripping the joint out. Dropped the torque 1.5nm down to 7nm and put gun back online.

6Y-180-01 ? Retracted not left ? Tool was getting stuck in the retracted position when trying to eject a screw. EL verified that the sensor that reads the tool is in the eject state was functioning, and it was. Called TM over to clean and inspect the jaw assembly of the gun, didn?t appear to be any issues. TM then greased and re-aligned the linear bearings. EL tried to use the eject screw function again and we received the same fault. Next we looked at the flow control on the top of the gun, this was reading 3.5 which is low. Turns out the jam nut on flow control was loose, I had PF turn up flow control to 4.5 along with tightening the jam nut and our eject issue went away.

Moved clamps on both LH and RH bodyside inner conveyor DOWN to clamp on the bottom flange of the rocker. Roy Drake investigated and came up with the idea to move them down. This will allow us to run the new rocker part without making any complicated modifications to the clamps. Clamp location also works with current level rocker and does not interfere with any of the clamps/details during pick-up from conveyor.

TMs came and removed feedstick and a rivet fell out. We cycled the escapement to ensure it was moving freely and it was. Magazine is on its side at maintenance so we couldn?t really feed one out manually. Sent it back in and got the same fault. We then brought it back out and hand loaded some rivets in the magazine. Looking into the mag we could see it had rivets but when we were hand loading we used an allen wrench to push them in and it seemed like one was lodged in the magazine track. After freeing it up with the hand loaded rivets we sent it back in and it ran fine the rest of the shift.

Shift note did not indicate any touch ups but EL said dayshift EL told them they did. We replaced bit and adjusted torque and depth on some spots. The screw heads were chewed up and the screw was seated which indicates it was trying to drive further when already seated.

553 LH SWB Rear Doors ? The saga continues with paint and the e-coat runout. At 12am tonight we went in and brought the hem adhesive further into the hem on all flanges above the window. Teardown looked good. Checked the robot programs out and found we call the same hem adhesive path for both Ford and Lincoln LH SWB doors. Went over to paint so they could show me the defect and how they were containing it. Not sure why they aren?t having the same problem with Lincolns. Only other thing I can think of is the inner to outer relationship is different on the Fords vs. the Lincolns. Could be possible the inner is ?short? compared to the outer on the Ford which could allow some more space or ?air? in the hem which would let e-coat in. Something worth investigating. They said they will monitor the doors built after the adjustment tonight and get back to us.",Anderson- Early in the shift there were several torque issues with the LH Rear door nab pin.  Several nab pins were not achieving the 10Nm torque and some torqued out before being tightened.

8Y10-5: Max time exceeded and min depth not reached step 15 program 24. Found torque setting on step 15 at 7kN, programming sheet indicates it should be at 8kN. Changed to 8kN, step 15 RPM also reduced to 240 from 260 and voltage(pressure) reduced from 1.15v to 1.0. All of these changes were to prevent the min depth not reached(by increasing torque value thereby allowing the screw to screw to depth and the reduced RPM's and voltage were to combat the strip outs. Seemed to work .

Brought over our test cable which already has the connector wired up that plugs into the VFD.  We thru it on the floor and ran it from the versa code reader to the panel.  Production went to early break, we were running before they came back.  After shift the framer electricians permanently ran a new cable and installed it in the cable tray.    Test cable has been returned to its place in the boiler room.   I have the pallet that was in the station at the time the versa code reader was knocked off, #20944 and the pallet in front it, #20919 programmed to come out at pallet repair.

#3 ? 6X-20-02 ? Nose switch fault ? 1x for 1hr8min ? Setter self-destructed on job resulting in a collision detect on the robot. EL had to manually teach it out of the job so TMs could replace setter. Once tool was brought out the TMs replaced the setter and punch. Home/calibrated and then we started to run. Rivmon had to be taught with the new setter so keep an eye out for any models that were not taught.
 
#5 ? 7X-20-R01 Gun #1 ? Head too low ? 10x for 43min ? Die broke off at stem right around start up. Fault was reset a few times and then the setter tebacle happened in framer station 20 so this was put on backburner. Once we got framer back running TMs and ELs went to this issue. Found the stem of the die was driven down into the c-frame due to it being reset a few times. TMs went to extract it by removing the set screw and punching it out but the stem was mushroomed and lodged in. Also found an excessive amount of the Loctite green epoxy holding the die pokeyoke in. The excessive epoxy got on the set screw and die stem itself resulting in them being cemented in and unable to remove. TMs then had to get drill, tap and extractors to remove both the stem and the set screw. Once everything was removed they replaced the die and we tried to run. Immediately started seeing Rivmon faults that were about 2-3mm out of tolerance. Went in and checked to ensure no damage was done to the punch and in the process of doing so we noticed the 2mm washer under the die was not installed. Installed the washer and we were able to run without issue from there.
 
#7 ? 6X-180-06 ? Head too low ? 4x for 25min ? End distance randomly spiked up and was faulting on every job. Put a gauge on the rivets and they were in spec so we started teaching Rivmon. Something seemed off so we brought the tool out and investigated further. Die was not broken or cracked but looking closer we noticed the pip was broken off/crushed. It is not uncommon for them to be crushed but this broke a little more off than usual. Had TMs replace the die and off we went. Had to re-teach Rivmon due to us adjusting it earlier.

EL Leo Mejias stated he touched up the program yesterday and it was missing the clearance hole low. Today at break he went in and touched it up and it was hitting high. This caused over 30min of the downtime. He thinks the holes are moving. I got with C-Lowe and dimensionally we are consistent. The plates the holes are in are riveted to the hydroform in the HFE sub. The plates are pinned in 2 places and there is no slop. Not sure what could be moving. He adjusted the program. We also had TMs come open up the gap on the jaws as it was not allowing the screw to feed in properly. After this our faults went from 17 down to 5. Seemed to get better but still monitoring.

Went in and found the bit completely rounded out on gun #2 and gun #1 in the stand. Had TMs come and replace the bit. The faults pretty much completely went away with new bit.

The new door inners that we are beginning run have had the snorkel/vent hole deleted.    We put in some error proofing to make sure we don't run doors with vent holes in the hinge set fixtures.

#3 6X-40-01 ? Head too high ? 8x for 22min ? Faulting on numerous spots with spikes in end distance. Rivets seemed a little high and it appeared it had bene riveting through a tape on the cowl top. Pulled out to maintenance and found the nose was full of gunk causing the bearings to bulge out. TMs and PFs replace GBSD and in process we found the punch had an excessive build up of black tar (most likely the cowl top tape) all down the sides and a large deposit of it on the end that had gathered rivet dust as well. Cleaned the punch up and installed the new GBSD and did not have any more issues. We used the last 160 GBSD off the shadow board. Stores had zero so I ordered 2 for nearly $20k. 4 tools in the shop use this GBSD so we should have 2 on hand to keep us up and running. I went in to follow up on this shortage and found McGovern rebuilt the one was swapped along with 4 more so we have plenty. The 2 ordered aren?t needed. Req has been cancelled.
 
#5 7K-20-R01 ? Step 4 ? 28x for 15min ? Getting step 4 faults which then led to a retry which then led to double feeds that needed to be cleared manually.

#4 5J-210-02 ? Time delay exceeded ? 7x for 56min ? EL said tool was faulting but no fault on Henrob. Found retries turned up to 9 which was causing the time out. Set that back down to 5. Went in and found rivets were being put in sideways due to the tape being overpulled a ton. Checked sprocket pressure and found it at about 45psi. Had TMs check punch to make sure it wasn?t damaged from punching on the sideways rivets. Punch was good but nose was slightly crooked. Straightened nose and turned sprocket pressure down to 20-25psi and we did not have another fault the rest of the night. Doug McGovern tested the GBSD that Dave gave me and it ran fine on the stand. He rebuilt it anyways.

8F-125-01 ? Spider bracket saga continues. Got a text from Lindley at the EOS saying he has been struggling so hard and fighting this issue on SWB (LH reinforcement) spots 19,20,21 and 22 only. Both sides have common robot, common rivet, common die and common part thickness. The parts are different in orientation but same material stack up. He said he already stepped the robot through and checked for any issues visually. Had him step robot through to check Z positional data LH vs. RH. RH Z position was 319.***mm. LH Z position was 314.***mm. Pretty substantial difference. Made all LH Z positions 319mm. We were not able to run parts but they will start up on SWB so we will monitor and see if it took care of it.

Had TMs replace bit and had EL touch up robot programs bringing the approach point further away from the metal (giving tool more depth range). This cleared up faults on 10-05. Used 3D printed teach tool with success.
 
8Y-10-06 ? Multiple faults across multiple programs for min depth and max time step 15. Also some max time step 14. At lunch ELs went and touched up this tool while they did 10-05. Also found this bit was rounded out. Had TMs come change the bit and found jaws bent. Removed head assembly to replace it and found bushing worn badly in an oblong shape. Replaced bushing. In process of doing so the TM dropped the retaining pin that holds the bushing in and it rolled under the PRB into oblivion?never to be seen again. TMs had to go retried pin from shop to get it back going. After this tool began faulting for spindle stroke position reached. Remedied this by adjusting spindle stroke sensor. Also instructed TMs to stock buggy with a few pins. Once we got up and running it ran much better.
 
6X-60-03 ? Step 15 max time faults. Overachieving depth and stripping out screws. At lunch (they tagged and we didn?t know) ELs went in and touched up program. The tool was missing clearance holes. Fixed this and still got faults primarily on program 24. Adjusted the pressure in step 13 along with RPM to match gun #1. This seemed to have helped greatly. Still monitoring though. Used 3D printed teach tool with success.
 
7K-40-R02 ? Step 15 max time faults. EL called and said he was fighting strip outs. Had TMs come and change rounded out bit which helped for a bit but then it began faulting again. Bodysides was running behind all night so we did not have time to mess with it while running so we swapped to gun #1. EL set to touch up program between shifts if he has the time and space.

6Y-180-01 ? When shift started it was on gun #1 for some reason. Gun #1 kept getting max time exceeded faults. It would complete a screw and then move onto the next spot and just sit there faulting in step 2 for max time. Hitting fault reset on the robot fixed it and it would continue on to the next spot and fault again. Gun #2 I was told wouldn?t run. We had TMs come and replace the head and we swapped over. Gun #2 ran well the remainder of shift. ELs cleaned contacts on the ATI. Since the fault didn?t carry over we are assuming its not a cable. Will dive into it this weekend.
 
7X-10 ? Start of shift inspectors notified me there was a long very thin segment on the LWB BS inner. Went in and could see the nozzle was dragging on the part.

7K-40L-01 ? Feed fault ? EL found rivet stuck in the sprocket drive. The way rivet was positioned it would not allow the sprocket to rotate and feed fresh tape into the tool. EL removed rivet and tool ran faultless the rest of the shift.
 
7B-10-01 ? Nut not present on ram ? PF turned down air pressure that blows the nut into the jaw assembly as nuts were visually floating when air pressure was on causing nut present to go low. EL also adjusted nut present switch closer to the incoming spac nut, tool ran for a short while and had the same fault. The fault that was occurring was misleading due to the fact the press pin already captured the spac nut, but with the way the logic was written that nut present sensor had to stay ON the whole press cycle. Controls made a minor edit to the logic so that once the press opens the advance valve and picks the nut up we are no longer looking for that but now an over traveled state or advanced. Tool ran much better the rest of shift.

#1 ? 8C-10-01 ? Unit 4PX SPAC PP not on ? 2x for 1hr43min ? Toolmakers went to tool a few times to clear nut jammed out at head/not making it to head. After the third call they went to replace the head of the nut press. I arrived and they were looking at it puzzled as to why the new head wouldn?t work. I informed them that we use 2 different sized SPAC nuts and they were trying to install the incorrect head assembly (too small). So they went back to the shop and retrieved the correct head and installed it. Even after the new head was installed we still couldn?t get a nut to make it all the way out. Adjusted the aligning plate on the head with a nut in it and still had issues. Went back into the feeder and found a chunk of wood (from a pallet) jammed in there. Cleared obstruction and tool took off. I was told they had already went through the feeder before attempting to replace the head. It does not appear that was the case.
 
#2 ? 9A-30-R01 ? Ram placement returned not on ? 1x for 2hr2min ? Bolts that hold plate which holds the sensor on the feed arm sheared off. There was absolutely no way to access these bolts easily. The entire feed arm assembly had to be disassembled and removed completely. Once it was removed the TMs had to take the feed arm back to the shop to extract the broken bolts. Once they were done doing that they brought it back over and have to completely reassemble it and install it back onto the tool to be verified.
 
#3/#4 ? 7B-10-01 ? Nut not present on ram ? 2xhr 1hr21min ? Fault occurred while HFE was down and line was about done running so it stayed latched.
 
#7 ? 8A-100-01 ? Feeder escapement counter exceeded ? 1x for 24min ? Jam caused tubing to run out of nuts. When attempting to refill it timed out. TMs came and cleared jam. Did not repeat.

#2 ? 7K-40-R04 ? Unable to connect to motor ? 3x for 50min ? EL stated he kept getting intermittent encoder faults. They dropped the tool off and swapped the ATI with one they had in their personal cabinet labeled ?good.? Immediately after swapping the robot went and attempted to pick up the gun but got ?unable to connect to motor? faults and would not leave the tool changer stand. EL tried to get the tool to unlock and drop off so he could swap the ATI again but it was latched up and wouldn?t unlock. Had EL drive robot home. In the process he snapped the limit switch off the gun/ATI stand. Fetched a new switch and took robot home. We were able to get the ?unable to connect to motor? fault to clear so we then brought the tool to maintenance without the tool. Once it was at maintenance we swapped the ATI with a brand new one. No faults existed and the tool went on to do its thing. After 1 job the we heard a loud crack from the LEONI and saw the corrugated tubing dangling with wires hanging out. In the process of working on the tool it appears the LEONI was moved/adjusted and it wrapped itself around the knuckle of the robot. Brought the tool to maintenance and replaced the bracket and adjusted the dress package. No more issues the rest of the shift.

8A-120-02 ? Invalid spot number ? 1x for 52min ? In mid cycle the tool stopped and the Henrob showed a ?invalid spot no.? fault. Robot was also showing head not back. We tried to get the robot to initiate FFR but it wouldn?t move because it did not see the head back. Manually homed the tool and went to run but the fault came right back. We checked cables to see if anything was split or loose and found nothing. We then cycled power on the Henrob controller with no luck. Chasing the ?invalid spot no.? fault I started digging into the Henrob just to make sure something wasn?t accidently hit. Couldn?t find anything. I then changed the spot ID the robot was calling out to a known good spot that had just ran and fault still showed along with the head not back issues. Then had TMs bring a setter over so we could just plug it up and see if it cleared the fault. As expected this didn?t work but we tried it anyhow. Began looking into the Henrob controller to see if there were any red lights or anything unplugged. Nothing jumped out. Cycled power another time and fault still was there. I think used the Henrob teach pendant to fire a rivet manually and it worked fine. So this told me the Henrob was communicating with itself without issue and the robot to Henrob communication had to be the problem. Cycled power on the robot and the fault disappeared and the tool continued to run rest of shift without a single issue. No clue what caused it?but if you see it cycle power on the robot.

First we went in and inspected the die/punch and cleaned all adhesive off. Faults still occurred. Next we had the TMs replace the die and punch. This also did not help. Tool was faulting at 5.01-5.10 bar and the max was set at 5.0 bar. I tried to adjusted the maximum pressure on the toolcheck and it would not allow me to change it to anything above 5.0 bar. At this point I had the TMs replace the entire punch/head assembly. We did not have one in the shop but we had one in stores. Had to jump through hoops set on fire in order to acquire the part from stores?thanks to our ever-so-friendly GS employee 12. Once we had the assembly we attempted to swap it out only to find the inner bore was not machined all the way through so the punch wouldn?t sit where it needed to. TMs took it back to the shop and fixed that and then brought it back to install it on the tool. Faults got better but still were happening intermittently. At this point we lowered the lineside pressure on the tool by about 3 PSI and did not have a fault the rest of the night. Monitor.

#3 ? 6X-60-01 ? BT2 fault ? 4x for 39min ? Both area ELs were off on vacation/personal time so we were scrambling to find coverage at start up and line went down. ELs went over and began troubleshooting BT2 fault and found a screw hung up at the coupling at the base of the robot. Called PFs over to clear obstruction. PFs took hose off at end connected to gun and blew air into the tube clearing the jammed screw. The EL sent it back in to run and we ran a couple of jobs and then got the fault again. Called PFs back over to swap to the back up feed tube. Once we swapped to the back up tube the issue went away. It appears one of the tubes was brand new but only running from the cube to the base of the robot. The entire tube was not replaced through dress package. Work order A100075923 written to replace BOTH feed tubes this weekend.
 
#4 ? 6X-90-01 ? Toolcheck NOK ? 2x for 31min ? Die on TOX gun was full of metal shavings/adhesive causing the fingers to stick open resulting in failed toolcheck. TMs were called to replace the die. Fault stayed latched due to us being in the cell working on 6X-60-01 at the time this went down.
 
#9 ? 6X-20-01 ? Dock gate not closed ? 1x for 19min ? Original fault was a cube A blow time fault. I was over working on RHBS at the time. Once we were done I went over there to find EL manually escaping copious amounts of rivets from the cube. I told him this would cause us to overfill?and sure enough it did. Once tool went to fill again it overfilled the magazine resulting in the dock gate not closed fault. EL then had to manually drive the robot away from the dock so we could clear the 10+ rivets jammed in there. We cleared the rivets blocking the dock gate and sent it back in to run. At this point it wouldn?t dock properly. Went in and noticed the pins of the dock were not going down into the mag. Taught robot away from dock again and found that one of the extra rivets and fallen down into the locating pin hole on the magazine. Had to find a small magnet to extract it. Once we cleared this and redocked the tool took off and ran without issue the remainder of the night.
 
7K-20-R06 ? Time delay exceeded/feed faults/nose switch faults ? 30x for 1hr ? EL reached out for help stating the robot was timing out and he couldn?t figure out why. Went over and noticed the retries on the sprocket for the Henrob were turned up to 9. This will allow the Henrob to continuously retry to feed rivets to the nose until the robot times out. Resulting in a time delay exceeded as opposed to a feed fault. Went in and inspected the rivet present cable and tape and it all looked good. Called TMs and PFs over to swap GBSD. GBSD swapped and then faults continued. Called TMs over again to adjust the nose switch housing. They opened the housing and adjusted the feed tube for the tape in a way that relieved the stress on the tape as it fed into the nose. In the process of doing this they found the UHMW collar on the feed tube was missing which was causing the tape the kind when entering the tube. They ended up finding the collar on the floor and put it back on securing it with tape. Also found the nose was bent which was not allowing the rivets to feed in properly. Replaced the nose with a straight nose and tool ran rest of shift without issue. Todd Dahl will be here tonight on OT and I have him slotted to make some of the UHMW collars for the feed tube.
 
7L-40-R01 ? Time delay exceeded ? 17x for 25min ? EL called stating the setter was bad. Went over and helped troubleshoot and identified the retries on the sprocket were turned up causing time delay exceeded faults as opposed to feed faults. Called TMs and PFs over to swap GBSD. Kept line running by continuously resetting the faults/manually valving the sprocket until other trades and new GBSD arrived. Installed new GBSD and tool ran.
 
7X-20-L01 Gun #2 ? Nose switch faults ? 9x for 25min ? While working on 7L-40-R01 I got a call to send TMs to S21. Went over to this location after we finished up RHBS to find TMs coming out saying they just changed the 2nd GBSD on the tool for nose switch faults. EL sent tool back in and it faulted again. I noticed the home offset was 5.400mm. This could cause the punch to sit low so I had the EL re-home the tool. This did not fix the issue and nose switch faults continued. He brought it out to maintenance and I had the TMs check the punch to ensure it was not mushroomed, burred, chipped or bent. TM stated it was good. Sent tool back in and got feed fault?EL noticed he never fed the tape back into the nose. He went in and attempted to do so but gun was buried in the fixture upside down so he couldn?t reach the tape. He came back out and brought the tool to maintenance so he could feed the tape into the nose. Once tape was fed in properly we sent it back in and got nose switch faults again. EL wanted to change the spool but I explained this would not resolve the issue. I went in and did a quick check to see if the punch was sticking in the nose and it was. Had TMs replace the punch and issue went away.","Anderson-3/3/20

7G-10L-03 ? Nose switch fault ? EL attempted to unjam a stud from the head, with no success. Tool was not running the same each cycle. While watching the panel view EL and I were able to narrow down a tube sensor on the gun failing. While in the cell wiggling cables I witnessed the tube sensor blink. At this point Ron grabbed his screw driver and secured the connections inside of the connector. Faults disappeared.
 
7G-50R-01 ? Max depth exceeded ? Tool was over-achieving depth but failing to properly seat the flow drill screw flush visually. Called TMs to give the gun a once over as it was running and then failed 6 screws in a row. TM found foot assembly to be bent along with the jaw gap to be far to open. TM replaced bent foot with new, along with properly setting the gap on the jaws. Tool ran great the rest of the shift.

#4 ? 6Y-180-01 ? FDS ? 12x for 28min ? Step 15 max time exceeded faults. Replaced bit that was worn. Area EL worked most of the night going through our lineside documentation and comparing it to what schedules we were currently running and making adjustments/un-doing adjustments that were made recently.
 
#5 ? 6Y-180-02 ? FDS ? 5x for 28min ? Strip outs. Bit was replaced and faults pretty much went away.
 
#9 ? 6X-60-02 ? FDS ? Strip outs. Replaced bit and faults went away. EL also going through schedules and discussing with me before making changes.
 
7G-70-L ? Shot pin not retracted ? 1x for 56min ? Pin assembly broken internally. TMs found new assembly and replaced it. Will go through and see if the old one can be repaired/rebuilt.
 
5C-330-01 ? Feed fault ? 2x for 30min ? EL called for a GBSD swap just after he finished changing rivet spool. TMs came over and went to remove the GBSD and found the bunch was broken off in the nose. Replaced the punch, nose and GBSD. Put it all back together and it went in and riveted one time and faulted again with a loud bang. TMs went in and found punch broke off in the nose again. It was then identified that the EL was yanking the tape through the nose until it came to an abrupt stop when the rivet hit the nose. In doing so it was jarring the rivet out of the tape sideways and causing the punch to fire on the sideways rivet resulting in the punch breaking and nose damage. Replaced nose and punch again. Talked to EL about not doing this and using the sprocket valve to advance the rivet into the nose. He said ?hes always done it that way.? He wont be doing it anymore.
 
7L-40-L03 ? Paint called with a complaint of ?splits? and gouges on the 553 SWB BS rear quarter outer. Touched up clinches 7K753-10-R78 and 7K753-10-R78 on 553 SWB due to clinch being too far in radius causing potential splits and nose dragging along rear outer causing damage to class A surface.","Worstell (Nights):

6X-110-04 ? Feed fault ? EL checked nose switch cable, along with blowing air through gbsd. Swapped gbsd and ran faultless for about 45min. Directly before lunch I received a second call for feed faults. At this time GBSD only had 400 hits on it, APB, sprocket drive, nose switch all appeared to be functioning properly. Tape witness marks showed signs of over pulling, requested PF turn air pressure from 42 to 38 PSI. EL manually jogged robot so the PF could adjust air-pressure causing robot to loose fast fault recovery. Thus resulting in the robot having to be manually taken back home, mark the unit as suspect along with giving it a complete for this specific station. I also gave the inspectors the rotation number so this unit could be inspected.
 
7L-40-03 ? Tox nose was scratching the LH 553 SWB body side outer. EL showed me a U553 SWB part on the pull off cart of where the damage was happening. While watching the line run in auto it was clear that the tox gun was not fully opening in between spots. Issue could have probably been resolved if we could have stopped the line and taken a minute to touchup the robot, but in order to keep production running we opened up the gun opening between problematic spot locations from 50 to 75. Cutoff rotation #7670
 
8Y-10-05 ? Step 15 max time exceeded ? Tool was failing to achieve final torque. EL requested TM?s take a look at the drive bit before editing schedules, Drive bit looked just fine. EL lowered RPM, along with lowering voltage by 0.2v in step 13 and 14. Faults slowed down after lunch.
 
6X-100-04 ? Operator installed tape wrong on roof reinforcement. Henrob riveted directly through the manually applied tape. Rivmon picked up on difference and faulted.

7G-20L-01 ? Nut not on ram ? EL had few faults with spac nut failing to be placed on ram. While watching the tool run it appeared as the flow control was set improperly. When the horizontal arm was traveling to its extended position, it was hitting the hard stop violently. Requested PF to lower the flow control to try and slow the horizontal arm down. No faults the rest of the shift.","Worstell (Nights):

Got to hang out with Koenig quite a bit today. He said he missed me.
#1 ? 9B-250-02 ? Clinch controller fault ? 18x for 1hr56min ? Our German fault showed up again. Ended up finding it was a failed toolcheck fault. Checked die to ensure it wasn?t broken and then sent it back in to run. Kept getting faults. At lunch I had TMs come replace the head and punch. Still faulting repeatedly. I was forced to essentially bypass the toolcheck feature in order to run. I suspect the pressure sensor for toolcheck has failed but we do not have any in stores. Currently checking to see if 558 has one to spare. Rick Gardner from TOX is coming in tomorrow to install some firmware and he will also assist in troubleshooting/repairing this tool. *Downtime exaggerated due to it going down just before lunch and we also couldn?t find an EL for nearly 30min because he went up to training class and no one came to fill in.*
 
#2 ? 9B-250-02 ? Clinch controller fault ? 1x for 1hr ? Toolcheck NOK fault. Broken clinch die. TMs came and replaced die as they worked on the punch and head of 9B-250-05. *Exaggerated downtime.*
 
#3 ? 7G-70-R01 ? FDS ? 2x for 33min ? Magically more than a handful of screws were fed out to the head jamming it up. TMs came to clear jam and then it went and screwed on top of another screw. TMs replaced bit.
 
#4 ? 8G-320-01 ? Feed fault ? 1x for 25min ? What originated as a feed fault somehow turned into the punch firing onto a sideway rivet causing the nose insert to rip out of the nose. TMs called to replace GBSD and nose. Crossmember required repair.
 
Had a rather extremely uneventful and uninformative meeting with paint gang today. Not even really sure what happened?but they don?t like us or the units we produce. Will continue to chip away at the laundry list of e-coat issues while trying to maintain our spec and eliminating squeeze out.

Requested TM?s to give the die / punch assembly a once over just to make sure, no issues. Requested PF to make sure all airlines were snug, no issues. Visited this tool after production finished and we found that the socket in the Leoni dress package fell out and had airline kinked while tool was at the home position. Raised min tool check pressure back to 0.70. Utilized the manual tool check function 10 times in a row without a single fault and the feedback was very consistent 1.41-1.43. ? MONITOR

No damage to the end effector though.  Had to remove a shim from the problem clamp to get it to consistently close.  Rear header outer fit to inner looked sloppy but dimensional said it has been an ongoing issue.  During the troubleshooting process it was noticed that there was a wad of dried up read sealer tape on pin clamp 2.  Removed the tape and then had issues picking from the conveyor.  Had to touch up the pick position.  I'm guessing that the pick had been touched up with the red tape on the pin clamp at one time.
 
9C-230-R01 Cowl Dash - Robot out of sequence.  Had to get spac memories corrected to run.
 
5J-TT210 Lift Gate - Turntable encoder value was not in range to show in position on face D.  Turn table would not move due to two clamps being in the wrong position.  After getting them into position we took the turn table out of position and back in and back in auto.

#8 ? 8Y-20-02 ? Double rivet ? 1x for 25min ? Tool began shift with feed faults. After a couple GBSDs it was then noticed the compliance cylinder was not operating correctly as the tool riveted. This was causing the tool to dent the metal severely and the rivets were too deep. Appears the lock function of the cylinder was shot. We were able to keep it running without bypassing it by bypassing the lock valve itself. Between shifts we went in and changed the valve itself but the issue remained. We then started checking the cables for the solenoids on the valve and that proved they were good. We then traced it to the Turck I/O block itself assuming one of the ports was bad. Replaced Turck I/O block and the issue was still there. Went back to bypassing the lock valve (you do this by turning the air all the way down to 0psi).

EL cleaned BT2 sensor, cleaned feed tube, checked for loose cables, with no indicators of what was failing. I requested EL swap over to Gun 1 to see if our faults were related to Gun 2 specifically. Called PF to swap feed tube while EL swapped over cables. Ran 1 part on Gun 1 for it to fault out for a BT2 on the second screw. Now knowing our issue is not gun related, it helped us narrow our issue down to the Festo valve pack on the screw hopper to be faulty. Found a new Valve pack in the cabinet and brought to EL and PF for installation. Turns out these valve packs are not configured the way the OEM weber valves are from the factory. EL and PF worked together to setup valve pack properly for weber feeder. PF re-installed new configured valve pack, and our BT2 faults vanished.

6X-40-05 ? Hot edit between shifts seemed to have worked but then I saw a head too low fault (didn?t seem to be a dry fire). Bodyside overhead was empty so I asked production if we could go in for a few minutes and touch up that spot. Production gave us the go-ahead so we went in and investigated. While checking the program at spot 185 on the 554 SWB Moonroof it was very clear the nose was colliding with the edge of the cut-out on the front header. This was resulting in damage to the tooling alone with dry fires and sideways rivets. Roy Drake adjusted the program and we verified it on the next unit. Rivet is now dead center in the cut-out and should no longer be an issue.
 
7K-30-R04 ? 29x for 42min ? Strip outs on all programs of gun #1. Switched over to gun #2 and began working on the same issue (strip outs). Made quite a few parameter adjustments to the point where it was only faulting on program 21. Continued to tweak program?mainly slowing it down and we saw very much better results. So far so good on dayshift start up.
 
7G-70-R02 ? Min depth not reached on spot 2 only. I couldn?t get over there during the shift but the EL made some adjustments with no luck. He called for some phone support and I instructed him to back the program away from the part to give the gun more room. This did not work also. Each time it faulted the screw was completely seated and it was almost over tightened dimpling the metal around it. Faulting out at -1.7 to -1.8mm depth. EL adjusted depth tolerance to keep it running. At start up I went over there and compared this tool to its mirror image tool on LH 7G and found the programs were vastly different. LH was running a much hard and slower schedule. Adjusted RH to match and our depths went from consistent -1.8mm to -1.1mm. Had EL adjust depth tolerance back down. Seems to be good now.",,Asbestos training complete for A crew,,\n\nParts:,,,

We don't have the exact reason as to why but we are easy to recovery.  I think we need to add a condition to this fault but will see if it persist.
 
Body Duration #4 - Electricians have swapped multiple pieces of hardware and the problem shows still.  The table isn't missing the raised flags but rather is giving the raised command and not making the raised input do to an enable or related signal dropping out.  I'm not exactly 100% sure about that but one of our seasoned electricians has been keeping an eye on it and it sounds like that is what is going on based on what he said.","Semelroth B-Crew 06/17/2020
 
7K40L-02: Max depth exceeded step 7/Clear screw at nose fault  x unkown. Gun was rebuilt in place, many screws were cleared and lines blown out. After careful deliberation and seeing the same issue twice today I now believe we had a metal issue. I witnessed a gap between the reinforcement and the roof rail that was around 7mm which was exactly how far off the step 7 fault was in every instance and would only hook up on the last hole. 
The take away is if you get a clear screw at nose fault with a max depth step 7 go in and verify the parts are mated up. We were only able to get out of this issue both times by skipping the first two screws and it would run the 3rd just fine and it has to have at least one screw to get it out of station.

7K-30-L05 - At start up we had with the cell dropping power and then an issue with the gun putting the screw halfway in the part faulting on step 7 for max depth exceeded. It was looking for a CSAN and then it would go in and try to screw on top of the screw that was half way in the part. Not sure how or why the gun was physically drilling into the part in step 7 but it was apparantely. Got everything in sequence and tried the next part but had the same issue. Had to swap over to gun #1 to get the line running. I checked the programs (faulting on all spots) to see if anything was fat fingered and did not find anythign abnormal.

Still faulting?EL called me over as he was about to have them put a second GBSD on and told me the tool ?wouldn?t fire a rivet.? I had him send the robot back in so I could see the issue and it indeed just sat there and didn?t attempt to rivet until it faulted for a time delay. I looked at the teach pendant and ?no rivet? was enabled which was causing the issue. It ran for a while after this but still had some sporadic feed faults due to the tape being underpulled. Had PFs adjust the sprocket pressure up slightly to overcome the underpull and it seemed to have resolved the issue.

#1 ? 9A-30-R01 ? Nut present on punch not on ? 4x for 1hr10min ? Numerous issues with this press tonight. This occurrence happened when the press was not punching the slugs out fully and the ram would get hung up on the nut and the part would get hung up on the die causing the tool to collision out. TMs came and replaced the die and also found the slug eject system completely packed solid full of slugs which is what was causing everything to bind up.
 
#4 ? 9A-30-R01 ? Power Stroke Not On ? 10x for 51min ? Ram not flagging the intensify switch only one 1 spot (2nd nut in sequence). At first PFs adjusted the air slightly which helped a little bit but not completely. We went in and manually fired the ram and intensify and saw we were barely making the switch and it was flickering. The linear bearings and rail were replaced last week and you could see the prox bracket was removed/moved. We adjusted the bracket slightly so it made solid when intensified and it was completely off when the ram was only extended. This resolved that particular issue. All suspect parts torqued out fine.
 
#5 ? 9A-30-R02 ? Nut present on punch still on ? Just as fault indicates the nut present switch was reading when there was no nut. EL had to adjust switch so it was not made when there was no nut.
 
#6 ? 9C-220-01 ? Press pressurized not on ? 12x for 39min ? Profil press not reaching pressurized switch. Watching it you could see it was barely flickering and would take a long time to complete its cycle. Sometimes it would fault. We found the dwell timer was increased in the logic to band aid this. Inspector said studs were good so we went in and adjusted the switch slightly so it was solid when pressurized. This corrected the problem for the remainder of shift.

PRB15 was not clear to enter PRB16 because the skid stop on PRB16 did not get positioner clamp open motion complete.  Logically it appears the clamp is on PRB16 but it is labeled as PRB15 positioner clamp at the clamp at the end of PRB15.  Anyway, the clamp cylindicators show the clamp both open and closed at the same time.  Put a dead branch in the logic to satisfy the clamp open motion complete.  See attached picture.\n","Nights ?

7L-30L-03 ? Double Rivet ? Henrob faulted as it should, Operator loaded two brackets instead of just one. Asked operator to pay close attention while loading parts. Between shifts I will be attending to this with tool makers on adding shims to the clamp so in the event two parts get loaded we will receive a ?clamp not closed? fault which is much easier to recover from (In the operator load station) than having to have a part removed from the line and swapped with a failsafe. Error proofing complete, Now when multiple parts get loaded into operator load station you receive a clamp not closed fault. 
 
6X-140-03 ? Feed Fault ? EL found nose switch cable internally ran through gbsd to have a short in it. TM Swapped GBSD. Later in the shift the same tool started to receive feed faults again. This time around it appeared the sprocket drive was not pulling with enough force. PF attempted to turn air pressure up to see if we could get sprocket to pull rivet tape through but gauge was unresponsive to adjustments. PF went and grabbed a new pressure gauge while TM?s swapped the GBSD to eliminate the GBSD from the equation. PF installed new gauge which was reading
5psi lower than the old gauge. Air pressure set to 55psi and tool ran the rest of the night without faults.

Had to replace the front right pin clamp on a pallet at UB pull out. Inspectors went to swap a unit and found it was not locking the unit down to the pallet. Recognized the inspectors (Steven Beck and Chris Cummins) for identifying this and getting it repaired before it turned into a scrap unit. TMs took pin apart and were not able to get it functioning due to internals being galled up and bent/worn. Also found the shaft of the cylinder was all scored up like it had been grabbed with channel locks quite a few times in an effort to force it closed. This did not help the cause. Found 1 pin clamp assembly in stores for ~$4k. Replaced and sent unit on its way.

Looked at the indicators for door patches on the operator displays.  The logic is a bit more advanced than what it should be, however the indicators I believe from the way the logic looks are shared between different models so I'll need to find a way to disable the indiactors for ford rears and make it specific to lincoln.   Same for Front.  Have not figured out how to do it.  I want to see the lincolns run and make the edits live and see how the system responds to it because the logic is a bit more in depth.

#2 ? 6Y-80-08 ? Valve/pin ? 3x for 1hr5min ? Pin bound up in stuffer plate causing robot to collision out. ELs could not get robot out and could not get pin to cycle fully to clear the fault. TMs were called to disassemble and clean but were unable to get it in the position it was in. PFs then came to check the cylinder. They were able to force it back into position which allowed the robot to move. TMs then were able to clean it up and apply some oil. Pin then cycled freely without an issue. In the midst of the chaos things got out of sequence with the EE and the robots zone. ELs were able to recover from this after some time. Once we got it all back in sequence the tool ran without another fault. Monitor for future occurrences with pin. We have 2 pin assemblies in the shop if needed. 1 is new from 558 and 1 appears to be repaired.
 
#4 ? 6W-40-08 ? Pin not advanced ? 1x for 36min ? Internals of pin assembly were broken. TMs found a new clamp and cylinder and swapped it out with assistance of the PFs. Took a bit to get the robot down to a good position and to find the pin assembly. Once we had parts in hand the swap was smooth and we did not have any further issues.

RH Ford Front Doors ? At 3:30a I was informed of an issue paint has been having ?for days on every single front door.? In the midst of trying to figure out the rear door cylinder situation we sent the ELs over to touch up the model in the line (RH 553). The bottom rear corner of the door had some pretty excessive squeeze out (even I thought it was bad). I had the EL push it away from the hem slightly as it was far into the root.

PFs checked their storage area and did not find one that would fit. We checked stores and at the same time had SD body checking for us. Stores had some and SD had some on hand.

C05 - Aisle crossing shuttle was jogged to the extended position rather than indexed.  It caused a software over travel and the cell got out of sequence due to a few attempts at fixing it.  The shuttle rarely has problems and there are some special situations you can get into so the guys focused this issue due to the lack of experience with it and seen it through.  We essentially had to trick the system into not being faulted to jog it outside the software limits and then index it back into position.  Once doing this we had to copy and shift the register data to get it going into full sequence.  This took a little longer than usual and we had more people working on it then we needed but everyone was unfamiliar and needed to see how to recover from it.

6X-20-05 ? Cube A run time ? TL had overfilled hopper excessively causing rivets not to rotate around bowl and onto track. Also found at least 2 jugs worth of rivets spilled on the floor and inside the cube. I rode by and saw TL picking them up off the floor and putting them in by hand. I stopped him and informed him that the rivets must be scrapped because we have no way of verifying the correct rivet is being picked up and put in cube. I then had the EL sweep up and discard all rivets on the floor and TMs vacuum out all the rivets in the cube.",,,,\n\nParts:,,,

Duration #4 & Occurrence #10 - C61VL10 Rail Encoder Feedback Fault Col AA 39 FB1 72 15 - Electrician said it happens from time to time but there may be an issue with the encoder head or a cord that is making contact.  Will have electricians examine for cause.  Also talked with electrician and tomorrow we will clean the encoder head that reads the rail.
 
Duration #5 - S090CV1 Conveyor Silhouette Gate Tripped FB4 18 24 - Operator bumped the guard which tripped the safeties.  Happens from time to time on the new conveyor that was added.  
 
Occurrence #1 - C61LT06 Shift Register Model Code Still Present Fault Col AA 36 FB1 58 14 - Looked at this after shift and seen that there was a 7 second timer that would satisfy and then the alarm would go off.  This was only happening when the routing changed from the main lane to the repair lane.  The path it takes on the cross transfer vs the main line was longer than 7 seconds but the same conditions applied so we changed the timer to 10 seconds.  Tomorrow we will see if the same conditions occur.

It remained faulted until I noticed it.  It will only effect the line if they need to pull another job.  I think this is why I have seen it the last few days because I've seen a few jobs pulled off recently.
